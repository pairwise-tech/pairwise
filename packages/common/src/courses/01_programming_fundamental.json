Together, they give you a complete education in full\\-stack software development. Pairwise can give you all the skills to start a new career in software development. Our curriculum focuses on teaching **TypeScript, React, **and** NodeJS**. If you are curious more about why we chose these technologies, feel free to [read our rationale here](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum).\n\nYou can access the course navigation by clicking the menu icon in the top left. This is always available for you to navigate to any challenge.\n\nThe first two modules introduce HTML/CSS and TypeScript, so they cover many of the basics of web development and programming. These two modules are completely free and no signup is required\\! However, you can create an account at any time \\(also free\\!\\) to track your progress \\(don't worry, we will track your progress even if you don't have an account yet\\).\n\nIf you do decide to continue and complete the entire course, there will be a one\\-time payment which will give you lifetime access to the course. You can make this payment with a credit card at anytime after signing up.\n\nThe primary mode of learning is through short, interactive coding challenges like the one you just solved. If you persist through the entire course, you will also build up a portfolio of projects you build and deploy on your own\\! You can use this portfolio as a showcase of your skills to future employers.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nEnough talking\\! To start learning you just need to start on the next challenge. Each challenge should just take 5\\-10 minutes to complete and will be simple and interactive just like the last. We know you're eager to click that **Next Challenge** button, but before you do we encourage you to watch this short video tutorial of how to use the _Pairwise Workspace_. It will give you some helpful tips which will help you get started, and after that we'll get out of your way\\! Good luck and welcome\\!\n\n++**TODO:**++** Add the intro video\\!**"

          "content": "Did you know that learning is itself a skill we can all learn and get better at? Let's talk a bit about the meta game of learning: How to learn _efficiently_. \n# Get a high\\-level view of what you're learning\n\nWhat I mean is, before diving in to the details something new \\(like this course\\) get an overview. I'll illustrate with an example: \n\n## To get an overview of this course you could...\n\n* Review the high level rational for the course [on the curriculum page](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum/). **\\(2 minutes\\)**\n* Open the navigation menu and skim through the titles. Try to internalize the high level roadmap. **\\(4 minutes\\)**\n   * Don't just read the module title and move on. Pause for at least 10 seconds and think \"Have I heard of this before? Does any of my existing knowledge tie in to this concept?\" \\(The answer may well be \"no\" but just try it out. For example, you've probably heard of databases. You may not know how they work but having heard of something can help you remember information about it later.\n   * You won't know how everything works just yet, but you can think to yourself \"So I'll start with basic programming concepts, then a programming language and eventually servers and databases.\"\n   * Having a clear idea in your head of where you're going will give you a better sense of your own progress and help you fit the different pieces together as you learn them.\n* When you start a module, skim through the navigation to get a sense of what challenges there will be and how many there are. **\\(5\\-10 minutes\\)**\n   * Also, open up the projects section and read through a project. Start at the end like this may be counterintuitive but it will give you a concrete example of _what_ you will learn. The projects are interim goals on your path to becoming a programmer. If a project sounds interesting keep it in mind as you go through challenges and you'll see how some challenges will apply to the project.\n\n\nThe same applies to traditional studies as well. If you just picked up a textbook try reading through the table of contents first, then skip to some problem sets _at the end_ of a few lessons to get a feel for what there is to learn.\n\nPart of what makes learning programming difficult is that ++there's no clear roadmap for how to become a programmer++. We know this because we've gone through the learning process ourselves and all of us had to create our own roadmap. That's why we've created the curriculum the way we did. Pairwise is a full roadmap for becoming a programmer. \n# Prioritize your learning\n\nThere's **A LOT** you could be learning in programming. If you want to see rapid progress you need to learn what's most relevant, first. If there's any time left you can learn more obscure topics later.\n\nFor example, here are some things you might be tempted to learn:\n\n* Multiple programming languages\n   * This is not a good use of time initially. Most programmers can program in more than one language, but we all had our _first_ language\\. Just learn one language at first and things will go much smoother. For this course we've chose TypeScript and we've laid out our reasoning here: [Pairwise Curriculum](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum/).\n* Obscure language features\n   * Every language has them, and for good reason—sometimes you need obscure features to get the job done. JavaScript \\(the language TypeScript is built on top of\\) is no exception, but these are features you can learn as you need them. For example, an introductory book on JavaScript will teach you about Bitwise Operators. When you come across this chapter **RUN**. This is not relevant yet and if it becomes relevant later you can learn about it then.\n* All language features\n   * Some people obsess about learning a language _completely _\\(I know because I used to be one such person...\\). This is not helpful. \n   * If you were just starting to learn English you would not benefit much from learning words like \"elucidate\", \"sanguine\", and \"wharf\" \\(if you disagree about this last one, you probably live near a wharf\\). You can be fully fluent in English without knowing every word. Likewise you can be fully fluent in a programming language without knowing every aspect of it. \n      * Confession: This author never learned JavaScript Generators 🙀They were just never needed for my work or personal projects. \n\n# Sleep\n\nThis is might be obvious but it bears repeating. ++When you're learning you need lots of sleep++. Your brain uses sleep in part to assimilate information you learn and synthesize new information. \n\nYou will be amazed how concepts you were barely grasping one day become easily understood and utilized the next day. It doesn't always happen as quickly as one day but it does happen. It's similar to learning a new human language. At first, nothing makes sense. The sounds are foreign, the script is tedious, the culture is incomprehensible. However, day by day sounds, words, actions all become more clear until eventually you're dreaming and conversing in a foreign language.\n\nSo get as much sleep as you can. You will learn more in less time.\n# Repetitions \\(aka practice\\)\n\nYou're going to need a lot. Despite learning as efficiently as you possibly can you will still need to do something more than once to get good at it. In fact you need to do it thousands of times.\n\nTo help convince you, consider...\n\n* **Sports**: How many times has Tiger Woods swung a golf club? How many times has Steph Curry shot a 3\\-pointer?\n* **Work**: How many do future\\-doctors _practice_ before they actually earn the title of doctor? Doctors may be extreme but also consider lawyers, plumbers, physicists, Spanish grammar teachers...\n* **School**: Teachers at all levels recognize the importance of repetitions. Homework is just a mechanism to incentivize repetitions.\n\n\n> To get good at something you need to do it many, many times ++even if you're learning as efficiently as possible++\n\nThis is where the challenges come in. We've created many challenges in part because we want you to attack the same problems again and again from different angles. Even if a challenge seems easy remember that you're completing more repetitions and getting better.\n# Real learning won't feel easy...\n\n... but that doesn't mean it's \"hard.\" When you're really learning you will be stretching your brain just a bit beyond what it already knows. This isn't going to feel easy, but it might feel exciting or fun. It might feel hard too, but even if it does, remember that it it gets easier with time. The better adapted your brain is to the task at hand the easier it will be. \n\nYour brain is literally building new neural connections when you learn—by the end of the course you will have a physically different brain than when you started. This won't happen overnight.\n# In summary\n\n* Start with an overview of whatever you're trying to learn\n* Prioritize your learning so you only spend time on the highest\\-impact concepts\n* Get _lots_ of sleep\n* Practice, practice, and then practice some more\n* Don't get discouraged. Learning isn't easy but it's extremely rewarding\n\n\nAnd if you feel that we left something out, you disagree about a specific point or you just want to leave us a note **please do**. We'd love to hear from you. \n\\(The feedback button is the question mark in the upper\\-right of the page\\)\n"

          "content": "HTML is the reason there is anything online to look at. It's ubiquitous online because without it there would be nothing. When you visit Facebook or Google or Reddit you're reading HTML. You're reading HTML right now.\n# What is HTML?\n\nHTML is a language for putting content into web browsers and telling browsers what content means what. Consider the following items:\n\n* Some plain text\n* Some _bold italic_ text\n* Some `code` text\n\n\nIt's easy to tell the difference and that's the point. Different parts of a webpage mean different things, and as programmers we need a way of telling a web browser what's what.\n\nLet's take another example. Consider the list above. Howe does the browser know that its' a list? How does it know to include a small dot in front of the text? The answer is HTML. \n\nConsider what that three\\-item list looks like to you, the reader, and also consider what it looks like in code:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li>Some plain text</li>\n  <li>\n    Some <strong><em>bold italic</em></strong> text\n  </li>\n  <li>Some <code>code</code> text</li>\n</ul>\n\n```\n\nIt looks quite different\\! The code above is what the browser sees. A `ul` with some `li`s inside tell the browser we want a list. Putting some text inside a `strong` and an `em` will make the text **bold** and _italic_ respectively\\. \n# Why are we learning HTML?\n\nA few reasons: \n\n* It's visual\n* It gives you real skills, quickly\n* It's foundational\n\n\nHere's what this in more detail.\n\n## 1\\. It's visual\n\nWhat you write in code will appear on screen. This is hugely important when you're first learning. Programmers specialize in telling computers what to do, and computers don't always give you visual feedback to let you know that your commands are achieving the desired result.\n\nThink about the clock on your phone. Seem simple right? It shows the time. It also adjusts for daylight savings time, or if you physically enter a different timezone. It can display the time in 24\\-hour format or AM\\-PM format. Consider this:\n\n* How does your phone know the time? \n* How does the clock update when daylight savings time shifts or when you step off of a plan? \n\n\nThis functionality, which we all take for granted, was programmed by someone. Imagine you are that person. If you program the phone to update its time based on your GPS location, how do you know it worked? There's no immediate visual feedback to tell you whether your code worked or not.\n\nIf you're writing HTML there is visual feedback, so you will know immediately if your code is doing what you want it to.\n\n## 2\\. It gives you real skills, quickly\n\nIf you learn the basics of HTML, guess what? You can make your own website. In fact, in this course we'll walk you through creating a website from scratch and getting it online for free. \n\nAt the end of this module you will be able to build something real, that you can see online and show to other people. In fact, using just the skills in this first module you can even build websites for other people and **get paid to do it**. There are many people around the world who make a living this way. \n\nOf course our goal is to give you the skills to be a full software engineer so we will go well beyond HTML. Which brings us to the final point...\n\n## 3\\. It's foundational\n\nHTML is everywhere, and not just on the web.\n\nConsider Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc. These massive companies all rely on HTML. They all have mobile apps too, but the web component is a significant part of their business.\n\nConsider also that the principles you learn while building HTML can translate into mobile app development as well. We will touch on this significantly in later parts of the course. For now, let's focus on HTML and dive in.\n# HTML Syntax\n\n\n## Tags\n\nAll those things you saw in the code at the beginning of the lesson, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, etc. are called tags. Don't worry, you don't have to remember this yet, but you will over time because this is how programmers talk about HTML and how we walk about it in our videos. \n\n### Anatomy of an HTML tag\n\nTags usually have two parts:\n\n* The opening tag\n* The closing tag\n\nOpening tags include a `<` symbol, followed by the name of the tag, followed by the `>` symbol\\. Closing tags are almost exactly the same. The only difference is that closing tags have a `/` symbol right after the `<`. Example:\n\n* `<p>I'm a paragraph</p>`\n\n\nReading through one character at a time, the opening \"P tag\" is `<` \\+ `p` \\+ `>`. The closing P tag is `<` \\+ `/` \\+ `p` \\+ `>`. You can use this rule for every tag you write. \n\nHere are a few more examples. Try to see the pattern of opening `<` \\+ tag name \\+ `>` and closing `</` \\+ tag name \\+ `>`.\n\n* `<a>Link</a>`\n* `<button>Click me</button>`\n* `<h1>Heading text</h1>`\n\n\n### Self\\-closing tags\n\nNot all tags have to correspond to a closing tags. Sometimes it wouldn't make sense to have any text inside the tag. For example, a `<p>` means a paragraph so you would expect some text inside. However, an `<img>` tag means an image and a `<video>` means a video. When you see one of these tags the browser knows to show the actual image or the actual video that the tag corresponds to, so there is no need to write additional text inside the tag. This is also true of input fields, where you can type things in to a webpage. Ever logged in to a site? Yeah, like that.\n\nHere are some common tags that are self\\-closing. \n\n* `<img />`\n* `<video />`\n* `<input />`\n\n\nNotice the syntax here. It's like the opening tag and closing tag got smushed together because there's nothing in between:\n\n* `<img></img>` becomes `<img />`\n* `<video></video>` becomes `<video />`\n* `<input></input>` becomes `<input />`\n\n\n## Properties\n\nThe final piece before we dive in to some code\\! Properties tell the browser things about the tag itself. This will become more clear with examples. Consider the `<img />` tag mentioned above. That points to an image, but how does the browser now what image? With a property.\n\n```markup\n<img src=\"https://placekitten.com/g/200/200\" />\n\n```\n\nThe key above is the `src` property\\. The syntax for properties looks like: property name \\+ `=` \\+ `\"` \\+ property value \\+ `\"`. All of this goes inside the opening tag, which is the only tag if it's self\\-closing like the `<img />` above\\.\n\nNow consider another example, perhaps the single most important property in all of HTML. The `href`:\n\n```markup\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/\">Don't click me if you value your time...</a>\n\n```\n\nThe `a` tag is the \"link\" on the web. It's what you click when after searching for something, or when shopping, or when doing research. It's a fundamental part of the web. Web pages include `a` tags which link to other pages. Without links the internet would just be a bunch of disperate web pages that you had to visit directly by typing the address into your browser. OK, back on topic.\n\nThe `href` property of the `a` tag tells the browser where to send someone when they click the link. \n\nThese examples are just meant to be an overview, in the coming challenges you'll use all these tags directly. There's no substitute for hands\\-on practice. Onward\\!"

          "content": "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, but that's unimportant. What matters here is that what CSS is how you change the way things _look_ on the web.\n\nWhere HTML is the \"stuff\", the actual content on a webpage, CSS is how all that stuff looks. Is the background dark with light text \\(like what you're reading right now\\)? Is there a menu bar near the top? How does the form on screen try to grab your attention with color and positioning? These are all questions CSS can answer.\n\nTo be specific, CSS tells the browser two things:\n\n* What we want to style\n* What we want it to look like\n\n# Selectors\n\nSelectors tell the browser what you want to style.\n\nFor example, you might say to yourself \"I want all the paragraphs on my site to be red\\!\" A very elegant design decision. In order to communicate this to the browser we can use CSS:\n\n```css\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n```\n\nRemember the `<p>` tag from earlier lessons? Using the tagname, `p`, we were able to \"select\" every paragraph on the page and make them all red. In this example `p` is the selector. Now let's talk about what's inside those brackets.\n# Properties\n\nCSS properties tell the browser how you want something to look. Let's say you're tired of drab white\\-background websites and want to mix it up with a `teal` background\\.\n\n```css\nbody {\n  background: teal;\n}\n\n```\n\n`body` will select the entire visible area of the web page, but we will touch on that more later. Focus on `background: teal;`. Here we have another CSS property `background` with a value of `teal`.\n\n> CSS properties take the form: property name \\+ `:` \\+ property value \\+ `;`.\n\n`background` and `color` are just two examples. There are quite a few CSS properties you can use, and the combination of them is responsible for styling every site you use on the internet.\n\nIf you're curious you can skim through [the full list of CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference), but we don't recommend it. It's a very dry read and by itself won't tell you what you really want to know which is what each property does. Furthermore, some CSS properties are so obscure that you can go your entire career without learning them on the job because they are just not useful in most context.\n# Blocks\n\nA \"block\" of CSS is simply the combination of selectors and properties. All the examples above are CSS blocks.\n\n> CSS blocks take the form: Selectors \\+ `{` \\+ properties \\+ `}`\n\nThese terms are not important for their own sake, but so that you aren't lost when you're working outside of this course. \n# The <style\\> tag connects HTML and CSS\n\nYou can't just write CSS anywhere in an HTML document and expect it to work. You have to write it **within a \\*\\***`style`**\\*\\* tag**. Like this:\n\n```html\n<style>\n  p { color: red; }\n</style>\n<p>Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nIf you write that without the `style` tag the browser will literally put `p { color: red; }` on the page for everyone to see. By putting that CSS code within a `style` tag you are telling the browser to treat it as CSS rather than HTML.\n# Specificity and the HTML class and id props\n\nImagine you have two paragraphs, and you want one to be `red` and the other to be `blue`. How would you select just one? Here's the HTML:\n\n```html\n<p>I want a blue background</p>\n<p>I want a red background</p>\n\n```\n\nYou might try the following CSS:\n\n```\np { background: red; }\np { background: blue; }\n\n```\n\nHowever, both paragraphs will be `blue`\\! Why? Two things are happening here:\n\n1. `p` selects every `<p>` tag, not just the first or the second.\n1. When you have two identical selectors \\(`p` and `p` above\\) and two identical property names \\(`background` and `background` above\\) whichever one comes last wins.\n\nPoint 1 can be addressed with IDs and classes, which we will discuss shortly.\n\nPoint 2, how conflicting styles get applied by the browser, is called \"specificity\". As in, the second CSS block is considered more _specific_ than the first, and therefore it wins and gets applied.\n\n## IDs\n\nAn ID is a unique identifier in the browser and it can be used as a selector. \n\n* There should only be 1 of any ID on a web page.\n* IDs are very specific, meaning if you select an ID in your CSS that CSS will most likely win over other styles\n* HTML uses the `id` property, CSS uses the `#` selector\\.\n\n\n```html\n<style>\n  #my-paragraph { color: red; }\n  p { color: blue; }\n</style>\n<p id=\"my-paragraph\">Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nEven though the `p` styles come last, the `#my-paragraph` styles get applied because they are more specific.\n\n> In general don't use IDs, use classes.\n\n## Classes\n\n* A class can be applied to as many things as you want.\n* Classes are more specific than tag names\n* HTML uses the `class` property, CSS uses the `.` selector\\.\n\n\n```markup\n<style>\n  .red-text { color: red; }\n  p { color: blue; }\n</style>\n<p class=\"red-text\">Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nThe text is again red because classes are more specific than tag names.\n\n> Classes are extremely useful and flexible. Use them a lot.\n# More to come...\n\nThat's a lot of information, and mostly meaningless without practice. There's more to CSS which we will dive into later, but for now let's practice everything we just talked about."

The most simple is what we've been doing so far, which is using colors that have names like `blue`, `red`, `black`, `green`, etc. However, if you had to rely on colors that have names you would be quite limited. HTML let's you define any custom color you want using some different syntax, namely HEX codes. For example, the color `white` can also be written `#ffffff`. Likewise `black` is `#000000` and `blue` is `#0000ff`. \n\nIn the meantime you can use named colors. There are quite a few, and often if you guess a color it will exist.

The \"box model\" is one such case because the concepts that fall under the box model are vital to being fluent in CSS.\n# What is the box model?\n\nThe official CSS documentation gives a nice overview:\n\n>  Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.\n\nTo put this another way, the box model is how elements are visually arranged on a web page. Now let's get a bit more concrete. There are a number of CSS properties that fall under the banner of the box model that we will be concerned with:\n\n* `width` and `height`: How wide or tall an element is.\n* `margin`: Visual space between elements.\n* `border`: Space around an element between it's `margin` and `padding`.\n* `display`: How an element interacts with other elements on the page. \n\n# The first line of all your CSS: border\\-box\n\nUtilizing the box model with regard to `width`,`height`, `margin`, `border`, and `padding` used to be tricky. The _visual_ size of an element—how large it looks to your eyes on screen—would be calculated as the sum of `width` or `height` \\+ `margin` \\+ `border` \\+ `padding`. This was unintuitive. When you say `width: 300px` you generally expect the element to be `300px` wide\\. \n\nIn fact, that behavior is still the default in browsers, which can make it difficult or time consuming to style your applications. However, **there is a better way**\\! Enter `box-sizing: border-box`.\n\n```css\n* {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat is this line doing?\n* `*` is selecting **everything** on the page. Every element. It's a special selector.\n* `box-sizing: border-box` Tells the browser that we want the `width` and `height` properties to determine the _visual_ width and _visual_ height of elements on the page.\n\n\n## A concrete example\n\nThis is all fairly abstract, so here's some code to help. You can drop this into the Sandbox and compare the visual difference between the two `div` elements\\. If you run this code in the sandbox you will notice that the content of the first `div` has the exact same width as the entire second `div`. \n\n```markup\n<style>\n  strong {\n    display: block;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n  div {\n    background: white;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    margin-top: 20px;\n  }\n  .outer {\n    background: lightblue;\n    width: 300px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border: 5px solid tomato;\n  }\n  .border-box {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"outer\">\n  <div>\n    <h3>Standard Box Model</h3>\n    <p>\n      This div shows how the box model works by default.

          "content": "# What are margins?\n\n> A margin is the visual space between one HTML element and another.\n\nUsing margins you can move elements away from each other to create visual space. However, you can also do this with `padding` and `border` so let's look at the differences between the three concepts. \n\n## How is this difference with padding ?\n\n* Padding is the visual space between an elements _content_ and it's edges\n* In other words, `padding` is visual space within an element while `margin` is visual space around \\(outside\\) an element.\n\n\n## How does margin relate to border ?\n\n* The `border` is between an elements `margin` and `padding` , and it usually has a color applied to it.\n\n# Beware, margins will \"collapse\"\n\nThere's a trick margins do that might confuse you when you first come across it: Margins will _collapse\\. _\n\nWhat this means is:\n\n> If two margins touch each other, they will _not combine_ but instead will collapse in to each other. This means the visual margin will only be as big as the larger of the two, not the combination of the two.\n\nFor now it's enough to know that this quirk exists. There's no good way to learn about this quirk other than to have it bite you while building an application. \n# When should I use margins?\n\nGenerally, when you want to move one element away from another element. Some examples:\n\n* You have a navigation menu of links and you want space between them\n* You want space between paragraphs in a blog post\n   * Consider the space between the paragraphs you're reading right now. You could do that with margins.\n* When you want to center something on the page \\(see below\\)\n\n\nUsing margins for centering is a special use case, which might not be obvious but is extremely common.\n# Margin auto\n\nThere's a special value you can use for margins called `auto`. For example:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat `auto` does is it tells the browser to \\_auto\\_matically use as much space as possible given all other margins. So, what the code above does is it moves anything with the `.centered` class to the center of the page.\n\nAs with most CSS properties, `margin` has a shorthand syntax that is commonly used for centering something on the page:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis example is equivalent to the long\\-hand version:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n\n```\n"

          "content": "# Padding\n\nPadding means \"space inside\" of something. This is why we had you change some background colors in this challenge. Without a background color it's hard to tell where the padding is. Of course you don't always want to show how wide or slim something is, so it's up to you whether or not you use padding with a background or without.\n\nPadding without a background color can be used just like margin to separate things, however, visual space created by padding is only visual space. The element with padding itself becomes wider. This can be very useful for things like menus and buttons, where you want something to have a large clickable area even if the element itself isn't very large on screen.\n# The Display Property\n\nThe `display` property is very important in CSS. It determines how HTML elements interact with each other on the page. For example, `<a>` tags have a default display property of `inline`, which means other components can ignore their vertical padding. However, `inline-block` means their padding cannot be ignored, and you will get the results you see in this challenge.\n\nSome important display properties:\n\n* `display: block;` This is the default for most elements \\(`div`, `p`, `h1`, etc\\) and puts things on their own line.\n* `display: inline-block;` This is useful when you want things to line up horizontally \\(`a` tags in a horizontal menu for example\\) and you also want to add margins or padding.\n* `display: flex;` This is useful when you want child elements to expand or contract to fit available space. This display property is super flexible, and you might find yourself using it all the time once you know it.\n\n\nThese display properties will make up most of your UI. The web app you're using right now was built with only these display properties."

You already saw some of this when we [talked about `box-sizing`](/workspace/nel5ggJ1), but there's yet more to cover. \n\nFun topics to come include:\n\n* Positioning \\(including the interesting `content` property\\)\n* More `display` property\n* Transforms\n\n# Why?\n\nSome of this stuff is bound to be fairly confusing at first and we take our content selection very seriously. So is it really that important? \n\n++Yes\\.++\n\nThe techniques we'll cover are extremely potent for creating _layouts_, which is the most confounding aspect of CSS. Almost everyone who has complained about any aspect of CSS ran into issues with their layout and spent entirely too long figuring out how to fix it. I would know, I've been that person—Everyone on the Pairwise team has in fact. \n\n> **Layouts vs Styling**\n> Layouts can be time consuming and frustrating to create when you don't know what you're doing. Styling, on the other hand, is quite straightforward.

This includes vertical, horizontal, _and_ z\\-axis positioning—Layering things on top of  or behind one another.\n\nSo to bring it back to the question: Why are we learning these things? So that you can build any UI you want.\n\nWith a bit of practice ++you will be able to code up the CSS for Instagram, Twitter, Amazon, Etsy or your cat's blog++ \\(this last one sounds easy but you'd probably spend more time on it than any of the others.

          "content": "# An introduction to positioning\n\nIn CSS the `position` property has a lot of power, but it's not necessarily clear how it works. There are three main positioning properties we're going to look at:\n\n* `position: relative;` That's what you were working with in this challenge.\n* `position: absolute;` More interesting than `relative` but you need them both together.\n* `position: fixed;` Very useful or annoying depending on your opinion. This is how websites \"fix\" a header or footer to the window as you scroll. If you've ever been on a cramped mobile site and the header would not leave you alone it's probably because of this CSS property.\n\n\nThere's also `position: static;`, which is the default for all elements. This means you won't see this property very often because it's always there unless you change it. Setting a `position` property on an element to **anything other than static** will make it \"positioned.\"\n\nAn element is considered \"positioned\" if it \n# What does this property let me do?\n\nIt lets you pick up an element and move it wherever you want relative to some other element.\n\nOnce you are using a position property you gain access to four new properties which let you control the location of an element on the page: `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```css\n.rel {\n    position: relative;\n    top: 20px;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis will visually move an element down by `20px`.\n\nThere are other challenges for `absolute` and `fixed` so let's talk about position `relative` first\\.\n# Relative to what?\n\nThis is one of those unintuitive properties in CSS. Relative positioning moves an element ++relative to itself++. That means, in the example above, the `.rel` element would be moved `20px` lower on the page than its initial position.\n# What does this let me do?\n\n* By far the most common use case of `position: relative;` is to set an element as an anchor for another element using `position: absolute;` \\(See [Position Absolute](/workspace/$TscTvcd)\\).\n* You can use relative positioning to \"nudge\" elements into the position you want.\n   * Sometimes your layout just won't cooperate. You can use relative positioning to cheat and force your element in a direction.\n   * I say \"nudge\" because if you're doing more significant repositioning you might want absolute positioning instead.\n\n# Relative and absolute\n\nI said we'd hold off on `position: absolute;` until another challenge but there's something we need to mention first: ++Absolute positioning and relative positioning need to work together to be effective++.\n\nWhen you use `positoin: absolute;` you are positioning an element _relative to the nearest parent element with_ `position: relative;`. \n\nIf that sounds confusing, don't worry—it is. It's best understood through examples and practice, so let's keep learning.\n# Resources\n\n* [Official documentation on relative positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Relative_positioning)\n\n"

In this example we positioned the `.label` elements in the upper\\-right of their parent elements.\n\nThe key is, the parent element has to have a position. Usually, this position is `position: relative;` because we don't want the parent to reposition itself, just serve as an anchor for the child element.\n\n> \n> ### The DOM Family Tree\n> \n> \\(if you're wondering what the DOM is, [here's a link to our that challenge](/workspace/C$3mo2yQ)\\)\n> \n> Programmers needed words to talk about the relationships between elements in the DOM and they understood that the DOM is a tree—much like a family tree. So when we talk about the DOM we use words you've heard many times before, but in a different context.\n> \n> **Parents:** When talking about the DOM we use the words \"parent\" or \"ancestor\" to refer to any element higher up in the tree.\n> **Siblings:** Any element at the same level in the tree. If you have three `a` tags inside a `div` the links are all siblings to each other. The `div` is their parent.\n> **Children: **Any element lower in the tree. Children are easy to identify in code because they are within another element.\n# DOM relationships and position absolute\n\nThe short version is: `position: absolute;` will position an element _relative to its nearest ancestor_ ++with a position++. Remember, for an element to be \"positioned\" it must have the position property set to either `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`.\n\nIf the element has no positioned ancestors then it will be relative to the `body` tag\\. This is what is happening in this challenge when you first load it up. You will see the `.label` elements displaying in the upper\\-right of_ the _`body` as opposed to their parent element.\n# A simple recipe\n\nLet's say you have two divs, `div.a` and `div.b`. If you want to display `div.a` relative to `div.b` do this:\n\n* Make sure `div.a` is inside `div.b`, in other words `div.b` is the parent of `div.a`.\n* Set `position: relative;` on `div.b` \\(The parent div\\).\n* Set `position: absolute;` on `div.a` \\(The child div\\).\n\n\nThen you can use the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right` properties to move `div.a` anywhere you want relative to `div.b`.\n# When would you use this?\n\n* You want to display a badge of some sort, like an unread count on an email app.\n   * You can see an example of this in this challenge.\n* You want some sort of custom border or edge to your element.\n   * You can see an example of this in the Pairwise navigation menu. Whenever you hover one of the challenge names it gets a \"border\" which is actually an absolutely positioned element, not a the `border` property\\.\n* When you want something to stretch to fit inside another element.\n   * This is a result of combinations of the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right` properties\\. We'll revisit this later.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Official Absolute Positioning Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Absolute_positioning)\n   * Just in case you're curious there are more examples in the official docs.\n\n"

There are several values you should be familiar with.\n\n```css\n.inline-block { display: inline-block; }\n.block { display: block; }\n.flex { display: flex; }\n.table { display: table; }\n\n```\n# Display Properties\n\nSetting `display` on an element let's you play around with how it interacts with other elements on the page. For example, `display: inline-block;` tells an element to flow \"in line\" with other inline elements but also to allow setting margins and padding. Setting `display: flex;` will tell an element reposition it's children in a row \\(or column\\).\n\nWe'll go through the key display properties one by one.\n\n## Inline Block\n\n```css\ndiv { display: inline-block; }\n\n```\n\nBy default many inline elements have unintuitive ways of handling margins and padding. It's often a good idea to apply  `display: inline-block;` to inline elements just so you don't bang your head against a wall for an hour trying to figure out why your `padding` isn't acting the way you expect.\n\n### Uses\n\n* You want to apply `margin` or `padding` to some inline element \\(`span` for example, or `a`\\).\n\n\n## Block\n\n```css\ndiv { display: block; }\n\n```\n\nThis is the default for most elements, so even if you want to make use of it you don't need to write it out explicitly. \n\n### Uses\n\n* Where display block can be more interesting is where you want an inline item to act like a block. Use `display: block;` on `a` tags to make a vertical nav menu.\n* Automatically size to take up all available width.\n\n\n## Flex\n\n```css\ndiv { display: flex; }\n\n```\n\n### Uses\n\n* Everything\\! \\(ok, not literally, but _almost_ everything\\).\n* Center items vertically, horizontally, or both.\n* Tell elements to take up \"Whatever space is left\" once other siblings are accounted for.\n* Space elements vertically or horizontally. You can justify them, clump them, put space between, etc.\n\n\nFlexbox is extremely _flex_ible, no pun intended \\(seriously\\). It's a workhorse for creating all sorts of layouts. If you're ever unsure how to get some layout you want, flexbox is often the answer.\n\nThat being said, there's a lot to learn and you won't use most of it very often. So focus on these properties:\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex; /* Of course */\n\n/* \n  You can control how elements grow or shrink to take advantage of space */\nflex: 1 100%;\n\n/* \n  Once you have a display: flex; on an element, use align-items and justify-content \n  to control how its children arrange themselves. */\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center; /* Also try: space-between, space-around, flex-end */\n\n```\n\n## Table\n\n```css\ndiv { display: table; }\n\n```\n\nIn all honesty you won't use this much. However, it does have one specific use case which you may find quite useful.\n\n### Uses\n\n* Tell an element to take up only as much spaces as needed, but otherwise behave like `block`.\n\n\nBy default any element with `display: block;` will stretch to be as wide as possible. You can assign a `width` property, `width: 500px;` for example, but that requires being specific about the width. What if you want to say \"Be as wide as you need to be, but no wider.\"? That's what display table lets you do.\n"

This project demonstrates coding a UI that works well in that context.\n* Building layouts based on _constraints_ is a key skill and it's better to learn through doing.\n* If you can build a an interface like the one in this challenge you've reached a professional level. There is _much_ more covered in the course but even at this point if you've mastered this module you know enough that someone would pay you to create websites.\n\n\n## Why not build a mobile app?\n\nYou absolute _can_ build a mobile app if that suits your needs, and we'll be diving deep into mobile in the Mobile module. For now, the purpose of this challenge is to get you more experience using the CSS concepts covered in this module and to show you what it's like to build a more full UI rather than just a bit of challenge code.\n\nBuilding mobile apps is significantly move involved than building for the web, and will involve many concepts we haven't touched on yet at this point in the course including:\n\n* TypeScript\n* React\n* CLIs\n* Build Pipelines\n\n\nThe good news is that almost all of what you're learning now is transferrable to building mobile apps in some way.

Don't get me wrong—_most of the web_ is just text documents with the occasional image, but it's important to generalize the concepts your learning to more abstract ideas like a Tic Tac Toe board.\n\nFurthermore, we can use the tic tac toe board again later in the course to make it into a fully functional game that you can play with others or against the computer.\n\nAnd of course as always just by programming, getting more repetitions, you're building the neural pathways that will make all this stuff come as second nature to you over time.\n\n---\n\n\n> **There's almost always more than one solution**\n> \n> This challenge can be accomplished with `flex-wrap` and a fixed `width` or with a more conventional approach of three \"row\" divs and three `div`s inside them to serve as squares on the board.\n> \n> In fact there are many ways you could complete this challenge that I wouldn't even think of. That's part of the beauty of programming—there's always more than one way to get something done. It can also be a curse at times because other programmers will often do things in different ways than you would, but that's beside the point.\n"

We haven't learned enough TypeScript for that yet, so this challenge is all about HTML and CSS.\n\nYou can complete this challenge in the [Sandbox](/workspace/sandbox?type=markup). Once you're satisfied with the result export it to an HTML file. \n# Why?\n\nThere are two particularly important aspects to this project:\n\n* Get familiar with building applications, not just webpages\n* Turn a graphic design into a real interface you can use\n\n\n\n## Applications not web pages\n\nMany people think of HTML and CSS as tools to build web _pages_. That's certainly true, but that's not all you can do with HTML and CSS. You can also build web _applications_.\n\n> **Web applications vs web pages**\n> Possibly a silly distinction, but you will hear these terms in the wild so let's touch on this briefly. \n> \n> \n>    * A web page is just something you read. A news site, a product page, etc.\n>    * A web application is something you interact with. It's software. Web apps also include web pages. For example, Pairwise is a web _application_ \\(you can interact with it\\) but there are many parts of app that you just read, like this page here.\n\n## From design to product\n\nTaking a graphic design and turning it into a finished product is a very important skill because:\n\n* If you work for a company or a client they might give you designs that need to turn into apps.\n* If you want to build your own product you will have to design it and then create it, even if \"designing\" it just means visualizing it in your mind before coding.\n\n# Tips and hints\n\n* You can code in whatever order works best for you, but if you're not sure then start by writing some basic HTML then give it some basic styling. Maybe create the outline of the calculator and get the size and background color right. Then move on to the inner details and repeat.\n* If you're feeling stuck try starting over from the beginning.\n   * This may seem counterintuitive but sometimes you need a blank slate to get new ideas flowing, and there's not actually that much code to write in this challenge so actually typing things out won't take too long. _Thinking about what to write_ is where you will spend most of your time.\n* If you really get stuck or you feel this challenge needs some work let us know\\! There is a feedback button in the header.\n* If you're not sure how to type a `±` symbol or a `÷` symbol just copy and paste from here.\n   * These are Unicode symbols, so it's possible to type them on your computer. It's often a pain though so when in doubt just try Googling around for the relevant symbol. \n\n"

          "content": "Also known as deploying your first static site.\n\n> \n> ### Jargon Time\n> \n> **Deploy**: Taking whatever code you wrote and uploading it to a server where it can be accessed. For example, no one else can see the code you wrote during this module but if you _deploy_ your code then anyone can access it with the URL. This is very important for websites.\n> **Static**: As opposed to \"dynamic.\" In this context static means that your code is just a bunch of files that can be used directly without any additional software.\n# Deployment\n\nThis is the general term for \"putting something online.\" In fact it's even more general than that. Deployment can also mean putting your mobile app on an app store. It really just means putting your code where it needs to be.\n\n## Deploying a website\n\nIn the case of a website your code needs to be on a server where anyone can access it.\n\n**NOTE:** Even if you're creating a private website with a login page and a password it's still accessible to \"anyone\" in that anyone can visit your login page, even if they can't access the content locked inside.\n\n\n## Deploying a server\n\nLater in the course we'll be deploying more than just websites and the process will be different than what you saw in the video. Deploying servers is a bit more complicated than deploying static websites because:\n\n* Deploying a website just requires moving some files to a remote computer.\n* Deploying a server requires moving some files and then _running those files_ on a remote computer.\n\n\nThe latter is what \"Cloud computing\" often refers to, but it's just a buzz word. Every \"cloud\" and every \"server\" is just someone else's computer that you rent. \n\n![This fridge sticker speaks the truth!](/assets/8YMC6xUd/5ee6958730a2bfb33dab02cf62857115_someone-elses-computer.png)\n\n## Why is hosting free sometimes?\n\nThe short answer is it's extremely cheap \\(on a marginal basis\\) to provide static hosting. It's so cheap in fact that business can make good money by providing free hosting to many many people and charging just small percentage of them for more advanced or business\\-related features. The trick is, hosting providers can run their own software to host _your_ site, and by running their own software they server a huge amount of traffic while incurring minimal cost per view.\n\nHowever, hosting for servers is usually not free. This is because your server code is real software that has to run on a computer. However, the hosting provider does not control the software. In fact, they have no idea what software you're running. Your software could be tremendously resource intensive, requiring large amounts of computing power and electricity to run.\n\nAs a result the price of hosting servers usually ranges from extremely cheap to extremely expensive. It just depends on what your servers do and how much traffic they serve.\n\n> \n> ### Web Traffic \\(This is an aside, feel free to skip\\)\n> \n> It may not be obvious from the outside, but hosting a lot of traffic is no mean feat. Generally websites load pretty fast assuming you have a decent internet connection. For a small amount of traffic this is very easy to accomplish. If you have, say, 100 visitors every month that's no problem. The cheapest server you can rent can host that traffic with ease. You could even host that traffic from your own computer \\(although you shouldn't\\).\n> \n> Now, consider the extreme opposite: Facebook. A quick Google search told me they had 2.4 _billion_ users per month in 2018. That's roughly 1000 users _per second_ \\(nonstop, for every second of the year\\!\\). Having that many users connect to your servers every single second is decidedly **not easy, **and very expensive.\n> \n> Now consider less extreme example: Stripe, one of the most widely used payment platforms online. Stripe has many users but they deal in _transactions_. When their servers get a hit it's because someone is spending money, which happens considerably less frequently than people posting status updates and selfies to a social network. Their server costs are likely _much_ smaller than those of Facebook. \n> \n> The point is, the amount of money you might spend on a server depends entirely on the users you serve and the software you are running.\n> \n> Generally, hosting is very cheap and if you ever manage to get to 2.4 million users per month you'll have investors breaking down your door to throw money at you, so you can afford it.\n# Resources\n\n* That sweet sweet website deployed in the video: [https://meditative\\-tic\\-tac\\-toe.netlify.com/](https://meditative-tic-tac-toe.netlify.com/)\n* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n   * This is the hosting provider we used in the video. They have an online interface for managing your sites, which make them much more user friendly if you're just starting out your technical journey.\n* [Surge\\.sh](https://surge.sh/)\n   * Similar to Netlify in that they provide free hosting.\n   * You will need to use a command line interface to use Surge \\(at least last time I checked\\). This makes it much harder to use before you're familiar with a terminal.\n* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)\n   * Totally free. The others listed here have paid plans but as far as I know Github Pages doesn't even let you pay. There are probably some limits associated with that but I've never run into them.\n   * Github Pages is the hardest to get set up of all the options here, which doesn't mean it's necessarily difficult it just requires familiarity with two things we haven't covered yet \\(but we will later\\): The command line and Git.\n\n"

Fair enough, it's a pretty bad explanation. Let's try to make things clearer. Check out this nifty code:\n\n```markup\n<body>\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"divly\">\n      One nifty div\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      This is the same code from the lesson on <code>relative</code> positioning\n      in CSS. We're going to use it to talk about <strong>THE DOM!</strong>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n\n```\n\nLooking at this code you can see that at the top we have the `body`. Within that we have a `div.container`. Within that we have our nifty `div.divly` as well as a `p` tag\\. Within the `p` tag we have some other tags... etc etc.\n\nThe code above has a hierarchical structure. \n\n> The DOM is the general term we use for the tree, or hierarchy, of elements on a web page.\n\nIt's one of those industry terms that you simply never need to know until you start working web programming. So even if this seems obscure or irrelevant just bear with me. For now you'll have to take my word that having terms to talk about \"the elements of a webpage\" is useful.\n# The DOM defines relationships\n\nOnce again, the DOM is a hierarchy or a tree. Here are some examples if you're unfamiliar with the abstract idea of a tree.\n\n## Real\\-world Trees\n\nThink of a family tree. There are parents, siblings and children. If you think of your own lineage you can think of your parents, and their parents, and their parents...  all the way back to the dawn of the human race. This hierarchical relationship \\(parents, siblings, children\\) is a tree, which is why your family tree is called that.\n\nThink of a large company. At the top their's the CEO, then there are other C\\-level executives, below them there might be department heads, then regional or project managers, then employees \\(i.e. people who don't manage other people\\). This is also a tree, although the relationships might have different names: boss, peers, direct reports.\n\nYou can of course also think of a literal tree \\(trunk, branches, leaves\\) but the DOM is a bit more abstract so the former examples might be more useful.\n\n## DOM Relationships\n\nLet's take the example from above and define some relationships. \n\n* Starting with the `body` we would say it has one child: `.container` and is the document \"root\" meaning it has no parents—no other elements above it.\n* Moving on to the `.container` div we would say its parent is `body`, it has zero siblings and two children: `.divly` and a `p` tag\\.\n* `.divly` has `.container` as its parent, has one sibling \\(`p`\\) and no children.\n   * **NOTE**: There is text within the div, but for the purposes of this explanation we're focusing solely on HTML tags.\n\n\nGiven these examples you can probably work out how we would describe the `p` tag and its children.\n"

If you have inline styles that contradict your regular CSS styles the inline styles take precedence and will be applied.\n* You cannot reuse inline styles. You can certainly copy and paste your inline styles anywhere you want, but you can't reuse styles the way you can with CSS classes. \n   * If you decide you want to change some inline styles for your whole site you will have to make the change everywhere, rather than just in one place. \n* Inline styles are usually harder to read. If you just have one or two CSS properties it's no problem, but it quickly starts becoming difficult to read inline styles as they expand.\n\n# When is this useful?\n\nGiven the downsides mentioned above, why use this at all?\n\n* You really just want some styles on one element. This happens, and inline styles are great for it.\n\n\nThat's pretty much it. However, if you're using a UI framework \\(React, for example\\) rather than plain HTML inline styles can actually be very powerful, because the framework will give you other ways to write them. We'll revisit this in UI programming.\n"

          "content": "Central to every TypeScript program is the data that it concerns, operates on, and manipulates. But what exactly is that data? How can it be described, and what are its properties?\n\nWell, TypeScript, like every programming language, has different _types_ of data. The number of types that can be created by a programming language’s users is infinite, however all languages, including TypeScript, have a set of built\\-in types, the lowest level of which are called **primitives**. These types can be operated on and manipulated by themselves, or be composed with other types to form more complex types, but this is a topic we’ll cover in more detail later. For now, let’s focus on TypeScript's most common **primitive data types**.\n\nFirst, though, let’s clear something up. \n\n## What exactly is a type?\n\nAt its most basic, a type describes a particular piece of data. A piece of data’s type lets us \\(and more importantly, the TypeScript compiler\\!\\) know how this particular piece of data can be used and what kind of operations can be performed on it. For example, something with the type `number`, should be able to be added, subtracted, divided, and multiplied with other pieces of data that also have the type `number`. Makes sense, right\\!?\n\nIn fact, you just learned your first type: `number`\\! As you might have guessed, this is one of TypeScript's primitive data types; one of the basic building blocks of the data found within a TypeScript program.\n\n> **Tip**\n> A compiler is responsible for translating code written in one programming language into another language. In many cases, compilers are responsible for translating human\\-readable source code into something called machine\\-code, which is highly optimized and only intended to be interpreted by computers. In the case of TypeScript, the compiler is responsible for translating TypeScript into JavaScript that can be executed anywhere JavaScript can be.\n\n## TypeScript Primitive Types\n\nTypeScript supports several primitive data types, including:\n\n* `number`\n* `string`\n* `boolean`\n* `null`\n* `undefined`\n\n\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, for the purpose of the next several lessons, these are the types you'll need to know. Let's take a closer look at each one in the next few challenges."

In TypeScript, _`number`_ refers to the data type, while `Number` refers to the  __global__, and more concrete, `Number` object, a concept that goes beyond the scope of this lesson. For now, it's just important that you understand the distinction, and that TypeScript is a case\\-sensitive programming language. While this may seem like a small difference, remember: in the case of `number` vs\\. `Number`, case matters\\!\n\n## Just one number\n\nIn the challenge above, we discussed that data with the type `number` in TypeScript can represent both whole and fractional values. While it is not important in the context of this course, you might find it interesting to know that commonly, in other program languages, fractional values, or _floating point_ values, are represented by another data type.

However, as data types become more complex, or potentially ambiguous, it is sometimes useful to be more _explicit_, and tell the compiler exactly what type of data it's dealing with.

Type annotations are a way to tell the compiler what type of data to expect, and how to treat that data. \n\nThe syntax `:` \\+ `type name` is used to annotate variables and other parts of our programs. They look like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst name: string = \"Finn\"; \n// use a colon followed by a type to explicitly type something\n\n```\n\nThis is not always necessary, since TypeScript does have very powerful type inference, which goes far beyond inferring primitive data types. However, it sometimes _is necessary_, and is often helpful to other developers reading your code to allow them to quickly and easily understand how something is intended to work and/or be used.\n\n> **Tip**\n> Hover over variable names and other parts of your code in the Pairwise workspace to see their type annotations.\n\nUsing explicit types can also act as a safeguard for catching type\\-errors before your code is even compiled \\(if you're using something called a linter, which the Pairwise workspace uses, as you'll soon see\\). For example:\n\n```typescript\nconst theMeaningOfLife: string = 42; \n// Error! TypeScript will complain about this\n\n```\n\nSince we've told TypeScript that `theMeaningOfLife` should be a `string`, it will warn us that we've tried to assign it a number to \\(denoted by a squiggly red line, just like a spellchecker\\). This is called **type error**, and is something we want to avoid.\n\nLet's try this out."

This is the only type we've learned about so far which is not a valid type in TypeScript's subset language, JavaScript. This is because `any` is _just a type_,\\_ \\_and JavaScript is not a statically typed language like its superset, TypeScript.\n\nIn other words, `any` cannot be expressed literally. It is not a primitive type, and has no actual value that corresponds to it, the way that integer literals can be assigned to the `number` type, and string literals can be assigned to `string`. Rather, _all values_ can be assigned to `any`. \n\n```typescript\nconst quux: any = \"foo bar baz\";\nconst quuz: any = 70000;\nconst corg: any = true;\nconst flob: any = undefined;\nconst glob: any = null;\n\n```\n\n`any` is sort of like a type check escape hatch.

Static type checking \\(such as in TypeScript\\), happens at compile\\-time, and helps to greatly reduce the occurrence of run\\-time errors in our code.\n\nUsing `any` can be extremely useful when we simply don't know the type of data something will be until run\\-time \\(when the code is actually executed\\). This might be because the data is coming from some external source that we don't have knowledge of beforehand, such as a program's end\\-user, or an external library. \n\nThat said, it is generally considered best practice to avoid using `any` wherever possible. This is because `any` makes our code less _type safe_: anything labeled as `any` will be type checked only at run\\-time \\(i.e. dynamically\\) and if there's a type mismatch, an error will be thrown, and your users' experience may impacted. \n\n> If `any` is overused, many of the benefits of using a statically typed language will be lost, and the incidence of run\\-time errors \\(something we always want to avoid\\!\\) is likely to increase. \n\nThe takeaway: use `any` sparingly, only when it is absolutely necessary."

Variables store _references_ to data, or _values_, which we can use in our programs. Here, `foo`  is of the type `number` and has a value of `100`.  `100` is stored in memory, but the variable `foo` holds a reference to that memory, so it can be called up again and again, and used throughout the program. This is an important concept:\n\n> Variables store references to values stored in memory, and do not store the values themselves.\n\nIn TypeScript, to give meaning to a variable, it must be _declared_, _initialized_, and _assigned_ a value. Let's break this down.\n\n## Declaration & Initialization\n\nThroughout the next several lessons, we'll primarily be using they keywords `let`  and `const` to declare our variables. Each of these keywords has a slightly different behavior, which we'll explore in more detail later.\n\nThe syntax for variable declaration requires one of these keywords and an identifier, or name, to act as the variable's unique identifier.  When we declare a variable, it is automatically _initialized_, and memory is allocated for it. Once initialized, a variable will be `undefined` until we assign a value to it. \n\n```typescript\nlet baz; // baz is undefined\n\n```\n\n## Assignment\n\nThat's where the `=` operator comes in. Assignment is pretty intuitive: to the left of the `=` is the variable that we're assigning a value to \\(the left operand\\), and to the right of it is the value that we're assigning \\(the right operand\\).  In other words, the assignment operator gives the value of its right operand to its left operand. That's it\\!\n\nA variable can be declared and initialized first, and assigned a value later in the program. \n\n```typescript\nlet baz; // baz has been declared and intialized, and is undefined\n// do something...\nbaz = \"a string\"; // baz has been assigned a value\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, a variable can be declared, initialized, and given a value in a single statement.\n\n```typescript\nconst bar = \"cool!\"; // bar has been declared, initialized, and assigned a value\n\n```\n\nA quick note here: the process of assigning a variable a value for the first time \\(as in the above example\\) is also sometimes referred to as \"initialization\", since we're \"initializing\" the variable with a value. However, from a theoretical standpoint, true \"initialization\" happens when the variable is declared and the JavaScript engine \\(which ultimately runs all of our TypeScript code, since TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript before execution\\) allocates memory for it.\n\nWe're going to dive deeper into variables and assignment in the next few lessons.\n\nLet's go\\!"

In other words, if you assign the string `\"immutable\"` to a variable declared with `const`, you can always count on that variable being equal to the string `\"immutable\"`. Likewise, if you assign it a number, a boolean, null, or undefined. These types are immutable by nature, and values of these types cannot change over time \\(if a string or number appears to change over time, it is really a new instance of a string or number\\).\n\nFor more complex data types, though, `const` can trip you up if you're not careful. Check out the following examples using arrays:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // error! arr cannot be reassigned\n\n```\n\nLike you would expect, you cannot assign `arr` a new array \\(or any other value\\). However:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr.push(4);\n// here, .push(4) adds the number 4 to the end of the list\n// the list now equals [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n```\n\nAlthough we didn't assign `arr` a new value, its current value is different than the value we originally assigned to it. More precisely, the array that `arr` references has been _mutated_.\n\nWe will explore the concept of immutability more in future lessons, but for now, you should be aware that `const` only ensures that a variable cannot be reassigned, _not_ that the value it references is immutable."

The increment operator can be used either _prefix_ or _postfix_, meaning either _before_, or _after_, its operand.\n\n```typescript\nlet a = 3;\nlet b = 3;\nlet c = ++a; // prefix usage\nlet d = b++; // postfix usage\n\n```\n\nWhile these expression look similar, their behavior is slightly different. The prefix operator increments its operand and returns its value _after being incremented_, while the postfix operator increments its operand and returns its value _before being incremented_. Let's take a look again with some results:\n\n```typescript\nlet a = 3;\nlet b = 3;\nlet c = ++a; // c = 4 prefix returned a after being incremented\nlet d = b++; // d = 3 postfix returned b before being incremented\n// a = 4, b = 4 both a and b were incremented\n\n```\n\n\n## The Decrement Operator\n\nSimilar to the increment operator, is the decrement, or `--` operator\\. It's a unary operator that behaves much the same way as the `++` operator, except that it decrements its numeric operand, rather than increments it. \n\n```\nlet x = 100;\nx--; // x = 99\n\n```\n\nLike the increment operator, `--` can only be used on variables declared with `let`. It also has identical prefix and postfix behaviors \\(if used prefix, it returns the value of its operand after being decremented, and vice versa if used postfix\\).\n\n```\nlet x = 100;\nlet q = 100;\nlet y = --x; // y = 99, x = 99\nlet z = q--; // z = 100, q = 99\n\n```\n\nWe're not going to cover this operator in a separate lesson, because its behavior is so similar to what we've covered here.

Let's take a quick look.\n\n## The Exponentiation Operator\n\nThe exponentiation or, `**`, operator raises the left\\-hand operand to the power of the right hand operand:\n\n```\nconst fourCubed = 4 ** 3; // 64\n\n```\n\n## The Unary Plus Operator\n\nThe unary plus, or `+`, operator, as its name suggests, only takes a single operand, and is used _prefix_, or immediately before its operand. Its only purpose is to convert its operand to a number \\(if it isn't one already\\) and return the result. Note that the operand itself _is not_ affected\\.\n\n```\nconst fiveAsString = \"5\";\nconst fiveAsNumber = +fiveAsString;\n// fiveAsString = \"5\", fiveAsNumber = 5\n\n```\n\nTry this out in the [sandbox](/workspace/sandbox) on more complex string representations of numbers \\(e.g. `\"-23543.0274\"`\\), and on values other than strings and see what you get\\! For instance, what do you expect the result to be when you use the unary plus operator on booleans or on `null`?\n\n```\nconst isTrue = true;\n+isTrue // ??\n\n```\n\nExperimentation and fun aside, It should be noted here, however, that there are other, more preferred ways to convert values to numbers in TypeScript. The unary plus operator is borderline esoteric, but will work just fine for simple use\\-cases. For more complex cases, other methods are preferred:\n\n```\nconst notReallyPi = \"3.14IsPie...err...ImeanPi\";\nconst definitelyNotPi = +notReallyPi; // NaN (not a number)\nconst pi = parseFloat(notReallyPi); // 3.14\n\n```\n\nThis example is obviously contrived, but you get the picture.\n\n## The Unary Negation Operator\n\nThe unary negation, or `-`, operator negates the value of its operand. If its operand is not a number, it also converts it to a number before negating it.\n\n```\nconst threeAsNumber = 3;\nconst threeAsString = \"3\";\n-threeAsString; // -3\n-threeAsNumber; // -3\n\n```\n"

When you have to do the same thing, over and over again, it can feel really tedious. Well, if you've ever thought to yourself \"There must be a better way\\! 😫\" then you're already thinking like a programmer.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of this writing there's not yet an affordable robot that can fold your clothes \\(if you know of one, please tell me\\!\\). However, there _is_ a way to quickly send event invites to people. It's called adding a bunch of recipients to the same email. Imagine if you had to actually send each email 1\\-by\\-1.\n\nThe point is, if it's digital ++you can find a way to make a computer do repetitive tasks for you++. That's what we're going to talk about in this section: Telling a computer to do the same thing over and over and over again... until it's done \\(or maybe even forever\\).\n\n> \n> ### Story Time \\(feel free to skip this completely\\)\n> \n> Back in college, before I knew how to program _at all_, I had a job working at our IT department. It was a pretty sweet gig: The hours were easy, the pay was decent \\(for an on\\-campus job\\), and my coworkers were great. It was even a job I could claim gave me technical skills on a resume \\(hah\\!\\). There was just one problem...\n> \n> **The job was extremely tedious.**\n> \n> One of my core responsibilities on the job was renaming and reorganizing video files that were uploaded by professors through some obscure campus portal software. These videos would find their way into a shared network drive where I could then access them using my super admin powers. \n> \n> This was very easy. I would open the upload folder for a professor and rename each file to include the current date, the professors user id, and the original name of the file. However, as I mentioned earlier, _this was \\__**super** tedious\\. \\_So, like any future programmer I thought to myself \"There must be a better way\\! 😫\" and then proceeded to do nothing about it for a whole week.\n> \n> After a week though, I had had enough and I set out on a Google\\-searching mission that eventually lead me to loops\\! Well, loops and a bunch of cobbled together code that semi\\-sort\\-of automated some of my tedious task using shell scripts \\(a topic we'll cover another time\\). The point is my job became much more enjoyable because I learned about looping. \n# Looping\n\nLooping is conceptually simple—it's telling a computer to do the same thing repeatedly until some condition is met. Let's jump in with an example:\n\n```\nhey\n\n```\n# Why looping is important\n\n"

For instance, consider the following code:\n\n```typescript\nconst aVeryScopedWorld = () => {\n  // The main function scope\n\n  {\n    // Some brackets scope\n    const anotherFunction = () => {\n      // Now we are inside a new function and new scope\n      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        // A new scope, yet again!\n\n        const theForLoopFunction = () => {\n          // A function defined inside the for loop!\n          // Yes, it also creates a new scope!\n          return i;\n        }\n\n        const result = theForLoopFunction();\n        console.log(result);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nOk, this is a bit overkill\\! But it should get the idea across. Each of these new functions or brackets creates a new local scope\\!\n\nAlso, it's worth pointing out how flexible TypeScript is here. You can create and nest different constructs like this in very flexible ways. This gives you a lot of options as you craft programs to perform tasks and also as you think about the design, organization, and architecture of your programs.\n\nFor instance, should you create that new function right here, in the body of another function, or should you write outside in order to better separate your code?"

          "content": "So far we have seen some simple examples of what scope is in a computer program and how it is defined by functions and block statements of code.\n\nOne of the main ways scope is useful is by giving you the ability to create separations between pieces of code. This helps to improve the organization and readability of your program, and it may prevent bugs and problems as well.\n\nHowever, scope is not the only tool a programmer has to accomplish a goal like this.\n\nLater on, you will learn how to write programs and build apps using a real code environment \\(not this fun editor playground in a browser\\!\\). When you reach that stage, you will have a lot of other tools at your disposal.\n\nFor example, you can define parts of your program in different files, put related files in different folders, and then _import_ values from one file into another. You can also control what you _import_ and _export_. This is a very powerful capability for organizing software programs. These same skills will also allow you to download open source code other people have written and import this code in your own projects as well\\! This is incredibly useful and opens the doors to building a number of interesting applications\\!\n\nYou will learn the details of this later, but for now just keep it in mind as a short preview and extension of the ideas of scopes which will come in handy later\\!\n\nTake a look at this code snippet for a short teaser:\n\n```typescript\n// This imports the library \"request\", which is open source and written\n// and maintained by other developers.\nimport request from \"request\";\n\n// The request library lets you make HTTP requests to URLs!\nrequest(\"http://www.google.com\", (error, response, body) => {\n  if (error) {\n    throw error;\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"Success!, Response received: \", body);\n    // Do somethine else here...\n  }\n});\n\n```\n"
