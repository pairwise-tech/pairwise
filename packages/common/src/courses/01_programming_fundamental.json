Together, they give you a complete education in full\\-stack software development. Pairwise can give you all the skills to start a new career in software development. Our curriculum focuses on teaching **TypeScript, React, **and** NodeJS**. If you are curious more about why we chose these technologies, feel free to [read our rationale here](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum).\n\nYou can access the course navigation by clicking the menu icon in the top left. This is always available for you to navigate to any challenge.\n\nThe first two modules introduce HTML/CSS and TypeScript, so they cover many of the basics of web development and programming. These two modules are completely free and no signup is required\\! However, you can create an account at any time \\(also free\\!\\) to track your progress \\(don't worry, we will track your progress even if you don't have an account yet\\).\n\nIf you do decide to continue and complete the entire course, there will be a one\\-time payment which will give you lifetime access to the course. You can make this payment with a credit card at anytime after signing up.\n\nThe primary mode of learning is through short, interactive coding challenges like the one you just solved. If you persist through the entire course, you will also build up a portfolio of projects you build and deploy on your own\\! You can use this portfolio as a showcase of your skills to future employers.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nEnough talking\\! To start learning you just need to start on the next challenge. Each challenge should just take 5\\-10 minutes to complete and will be simple and interactive just like the last. We know you're eager to click that **Next Challenge** button, but before you do we encourage you to watch this short video tutorial of how to use the _Pairwise Workspace_. It will give you some helpful tips which will help you get started, and after that we'll get out of your way\\! Good luck and welcome\\!\n\n++**TODO:**++** Add the intro video\\!**"

Let's talk a bit about the meta game of learning: How to learn _efficiently_. \n# Taking Breaks\n\n++TODO++ Primacy and recency? When stuck, take a break, better yet a nap\n# Sleep\n\n++TODO++ Naps are good, full\\-nights sleep is better, avoid alcohol while learning\n# Repetitions aka practice\n\nYou're going to need a lot. Despite learning as efficiently as you possibly can you will still need to do something more than once to get good at it. In fact you need to do it thousands of times.\n\nTo help convince you, consider...\n\n* **Sports**: How many times has Tiger Woods swung a golf club? How many times has Steph Curry shot a 3\\-pointer?\n* **Work**: How many do future\\-doctors _practice_ before they actually earn the title of doctor? Doctors may be extreme but also consider lawyers, plumbers, physicists, Spanish grammar teachers...\n* **School**: Teachers at all levels recognize the importance of repetitions. Homework is just a mechanism to incentivize repetitions.\n\n\n> To get good at something you need to do it many, many times ++even if you're learning as efficiently as possible++\n\nThis is where the challenges come in. We've created many challenges in part because we want you to attack the same problems again and again from different angles. Even if a challenge seems easy remember that you're completing more repetitions and getting better.\n# Real learning won't feel easy...\n\n... but that doesn't mean it's \"hard.\" When you're really learning you will be stretching your brain just a bit beyond what it already knows. This isn't going to feel easy, but it might feel exciting or fun. It might feel hard too, but even if it does, remember that it it gets easier with time. The better adapted your brain is to the task at hand the easier it will be. \n\nYour brain is literally building new neural connections when you learnâ€”by the end of the course you will have a physically different brain than when you started. This won't happen overnight."

          "content": "HTML is the reason there is anything online to look at. It's ubiquitous online because without it there would be nothing. When you visit Facebook or Google or Reddit you're reading HTML. You're reading HTML right now.\n# What is HTML?\n\nHTML is a language for putting content into web browsers and telling browsers what content means what. Consider the following items:\n\n* Some plain text\n* Some _bold italic_ text\n* Some `code` text\n\n\nIt's easy to tell the difference and that's the point. Different parts of a webpage mean different things, and as programmers we need a way of telling a web browser what's what.\n\nLet's take another example. Consider the list above. Howe does the browser know that its' a list? How does it know to include a small dot in front of the text? The answer is HTML. \n\nConsider what that three\\-item list looks like to you, the reader, and also consider what it looks like in code:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li>Some plain text</li>\n  <li>\n    Some <strong><em>bold italic</em></strong> text\n  </li>\n  <li>Some <code>code</code> text</li>\n</ul>\n\n```\n\nIt looks quite different\\! The code above is what the browser sees. A `ul` with some `li`s inside tell the browser we want a list. Putting some text inside a `strong` and an `em` will make the text **bold** and _italic_ respectively\\. \n# Why are we learning HTML?\n\nA few reasons: \n\n* It's visual\n* It gives you real skills, quickly\n* It's foundational\n\n\nHere's what this in more detail.\n\n## 1\\. It's visual\n\nWhat you write in code will appear on screen. This is hugely important when you're first learning. Programmers specialize in telling computers what to do, and computers don't always give you visual feedback to let you know that your commands are achieving the desired result.\n\nThink about the clock on your phone. Seem simple right? It shows the time. It also adjusts for daylight savings time, or if you physically enter a different timezone. It can display the time in 24\\-hour format or AM\\-PM format. Consider this:\n\n* How does your phone know the time? \n* How does the clock update when daylight savings time shifts or when you step off of a plan? \n\n\nThis functionality, which we all take for granted, was programmed by someone. Imagine you are that person. If you program the phone to update its time based on your GPS location, how do you know it worked? There's no immediate visual feedback to tell you whether your code worked or not.\n\nIf you're writing HTML there is visual feedback, so you will know immediately if your code is doing what you want it to.\n\n## 2\\. It gives you real skills, quickly\n\nIf you learn the basics of HTML, guess what? You can make your own website. In fact, in this course we'll walk you through creating a website from scratch and getting it online for free. \n\nAt the end of this module you will be able to build something real, that you can see online and show to other people. In fact, using just the skills in this first module you can even build websites for other people and **get paid to do it**. There are many people around the world who make a living this way. \n\nOf course our goal is to give you the skills to be a full software engineer so we will go well beyond HTML. Which brings us to the final point...\n\n## 3\\. It's foundational\n\nHTML is everywhere, and not just on the web.\n\nConsider Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc. These massive companies all rely on HTML. They all have mobile apps too, but the web component is a significant part of their business.\n\nConsider also that the principles you learn while building HTML can translate into mobile app development as well. We will touch on this significantly in later parts of the course. For now, let's focus on HTML and dive in.\n# HTML Syntax\n\n\n## Tags\n\nAll those things you saw in the code at the beginning of the lesson, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, etc. are called tags. Don't worry, you don't have to remember this yet, but you will over time because this is how programmers talk about HTML and how we walk about it in our videos. \n\n### Anatomy of an HTML tag\n\nTags usually have two parts:\n\n* The opening tag\n* The closing tag\n\nOpening tags include a `<` symbol, followed by the name of the tag, followed by the `>` symbol\\. Closing tags are almost exactly the same. The only difference is that closing tags have a `/` symbol right after the `<`. Example:\n\n* `<p>I'm a paragraph</p>`\n\n\nReading through one character at a time, the opening \"P tag\" is `<` \\+ `p` \\+ `>`. The closing P tag is `<` \\+ `/` \\+ `p` \\+ `>`. You can use this rule for every tag you write. \n\nHere are a few more examples. Try to see the pattern of opening `<` \\+ tag name \\+ `>` and closing `</` \\+ tag name \\+ `>`.\n\n* `<a>Link</a>`\n* `<button>Click me</button>`\n* `<h1>Heading text</h1>`\n\n\n### Self\\-closing tags\n\nNot all tags have to correspond to a closing tags. Sometimes it wouldn't make sense to have any text inside the tag. For example, a `<p>` means a paragraph so you would expect some text inside. However, an `<img>` tag means an image and a `<video>` means a video. When you see one of these tags the browser knows to show the actual image or the actual video that the tag corresponds to, so there is no need to write additional text inside the tag. This is also true of input fields, where you can type things in to a webpage. Ever logged in to a site? Yeah, like that.\n\nHere are some common tags that are self\\-closing. \n\n* `<img />`\n* `<video />`\n* `<input />`\n\n\nNotice the syntax here. It's like the opening tag and closing tag got smushed together because there's nothing in between:\n\n* `<img></img>` becomes `<img />`\n* `<video></video>` becomes `<video />`\n* `<input></input>` becomes `<input />`\n\n\n## Properties\n\nThe final piece before we dive in to some code\\! Properties tell the browser things about the tag itself. This will become more clear with examples. Consider the `<img />` tag mentioned above. That points to an image, but how does the browser now what image? With a property.\n\n```markup\n<img src=\"https://placekitten.com/g/200/200\" />\n\n```\n\nThe key above is the `src` property\\. The syntax for properties looks like: property name \\+ `=` \\+ `\"` \\+ property value \\+ `\"`. All of this goes inside the opening tag, which is the only tag if it's self\\-closing like the `<img />` above\\.\n\nNow consider another example, perhaps the single most important property in all of HTML. The `href`:\n\n```markup\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/\">Don't click me if you value your time...</a>\n\n```\n\nThe `a` tag is the \"link\" on the web. It's what you click when after searching for something, or when shopping, or when doing research. It's a fundamental part of the web. Web pages include `a` tags which link to other pages. Without links the internet would just be a bunch of disperate web pages that you had to visit directly by typing the address into your browser. OK, back on topic.\n\nThe `href` property of the `a` tag tells the browser where to send someone when they click the link. \n\nThese examples are just meant to be an overview, in the coming challenges you'll use all these tags directly. There's no substitute for hands\\-on practice. Onward\\!"

          "content": "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, but that's unimportant. What matters here is that what CSS is how you change the way things _look_ on the web.\n\nWhere HTML is the \"stuff\", the actual content on a webpage, CSS is how all that stuff looks. Is the background dark with light text \\(like what you're reading right now\\)? Is there a menu bar near the top? How does the form on screen try to grab your attention with color and positioning? These are all questions CSS can answer.\n\nTo be specific, CSS tells the browser two things:\n\n* What we want to style\n* What we want it to look like\n\n# Selectors\n\nSelectors tell the browser what you want to style.\n\nFor example, you might say to yourself \"I want all the paragraphs on my site to be red\\!\" A very elegant design decision. In order to communicate this to the browser we can use CSS:\n\n```css\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n```\n\nRemember the `<p>` tag from earlier lessons? Using the tagname, `p`, we were able to \"select\" every paragraph on the page and make them all red. In this example `p` is the selector. Now let's talk about what's inside those brackets.\n# Properties\n\nCSS properties tell the browser how you want something to look. Let's say you're tired of drab white\\-background websites and want to mix it up with a `teal` background\\.\n\n```css\nbody {\n  background: teal;\n}\n\n```\n\n`body` will select the entire visible area of the web page, but we will touch on that more later. Focus on `background: teal;`. Here we have another CSS property `background` with a value of `teal`.\n\n> CSS properties take the form: property name \\+ `:` \\+ property value \\+ `;`.\n\n`background` and `color` are just two examples. There are quite a few CSS properties you can use, and the combination of them is responsible for styling every site you use on the internet.\n\nIf you're curious you can skim through [the full list of CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference), but we don't recommend it. It's a very dry read and by itself won't tell you what you really want to know which is what each property does. Furthermore, some CSS properties are so obscure that you can go your entire career without learning them on the job because they are just not useful in most context.\n# Blocks\n\nA \"block\" of CSS is simply the combination of selectors and properties. All the examples above are CSS blocks.\n\n> CSS blocks take the form: Selectors \\+ `{` \\+ properties \\+ `}`\n\nThese terms are not important for their own sake, but so that you aren't lost when you're working outside of this course. \n# The <style\\> tag connects HTML and CSS\n\nYou can't just write CSS anywhere in an HTML document and expect it to work. You have to write it **within a \\*\\***`style`**\\*\\* tag**. Like this:\n\n```html\n<style>\n  p { color: red; }\n</style>\n<p>Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nIf you write that without the `style` tag the browser will literally put `p { color: red; }` on the page for everyone to see. By putting that CSS code within a `style` tag you are telling the browser to treat it as CSS rather than HTML.\n# Specificity and the HTML class and id props\n\nImagine you have two paragraphs, and you want one to be `red` and the other to be `blue`. How would you select just one? Here's the HTML:\n\n```html\n<p>I want a blue background</p>\n<p>I want a red background</p>\n\n```\n\nYou might try the following CSS:\n\n```\np { background: red; }\np { background: blue; }\n\n```\n\nHowever, both paragraphs will be `blue`\\! Why? Two things are happening here:\n\n1. `p` selects every `<p>` tag, not just the first or the second.\n1. When you have two identical selectors \\(`p` and `p` above\\) and two identical property names \\(`background` and `background` above\\) whichever one comes last wins.\n\nPoint 1 can be addressed with IDs and classes, which we will discuss shortly.\n\nPoint 2, how conflicting styles get applied by the browser, is called \"specificity\". As in, the second CSS block is considered more _specific_ than the first, and therefore it wins and gets applied.\n\n## IDs\n\nAn ID is a unique identifier in the browser and it can be used as a selector. \n\n* There should only be 1 of any ID on a web page.\n* IDs are very specific, meaning if you select an ID in your CSS that CSS will most likely win over other styles\n* HTML uses the `id` property, CSS uses the `#` selector\\.\n\n\n```html\n<style>\n  #my-paragraph { color: red; }\n  p { color: blue; }\n</style>\n<p id=\"my-paragraph\">Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nEven though the `p` styles come last, the `#my-paragraph` styles get applied because they are more specific.\n\n> In general don't use IDs, use classes.\n\n## Classes\n\n* A class can be applied to as many things as you want.\n* Classes are more specific than tag names\n* HTML uses the `class` property, CSS uses the `.` selector\\.\n\n\n```markup\n<style>\n  .red-text { color: red; }\n  p { color: blue; }\n</style>\n<p class=\"red-text\">Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nThe text is again red because classes are more specific than tag names.\n\n> Classes are extremely useful and flexible. Use them a lot.\n# More to come...\n\nThat's a lot of information, and mostly meaningless without practice. There's more to CSS which we will dive into later, but for now let's practice everything we just talked about."

The most simple is what we've been doing so far, which is using colors that have names like `blue`, `red`, `black`, `green`, etc. However, if you had to rely on colors that have names you would be quite limited. HTML let's you define any custom color you want using some different syntax, namely HEX codes. For example, the color `white` can also be written `#ffffff`. Likewise `black` is `#000000` and `blue` is `#0000ff`. \n\nIn the meantime you can use named colors. There are quite a few, and often if you guess a color it will exist. You can see the full list here: <https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors\\_names.asp\\>"

          "content": "I'm no fan of jargon, but sometimes you just gotta learn it. The \"box model\" is one such case because the concepts that fall under the box model are vital to being fluent in CSS.\n# What is the box model?\n\nThe official CSS documentation gives a nice overview:\n\n>  Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.\n\nTo put this another way, the box model is how elements are visually arranged on a web page. Now let's get a bit more concrete. There are a number of CSS properties that fall under the banner of the box model that we will be concerned with:\n\n* `width` and `height`: How wide or tall an element is.\n* `margin`: Visual space between elements.\n* `border`: Space around an element between it's `margin` and `padding`.\n* `display`: How an element interacts with other elements on the page. \n\n# The first line of all your CSS: border\\-box\n\nUtilizing the box model with regard to `width`,`height`, `margin`, `border`, and `padding` used to be tricky. The _visual_ size of an elementâ€”how large it looks to your eyes on screenâ€”would be calculated as the sum of `width` or `height` \\+ `margin` \\+ `border` \\+ `padding`. This was unintuitive. When you say `width: 300px` you generally expect the element to be `300px` wide\\. \n\nIn fact, that behavior is still the default in browsers, which can make it difficult or time consuming to style your applications. However, **there is a better way**\\! Enter `box-sizing: border-box`.\n\n```css\n* {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat is this line doing?\n* `*` is selecting **everything** on the page. Every element. It's a special selector.\n* `box-sizing: border-box` Tells the browser that we want the `width` and `height` properties to determine the _visual_ width and _visual_ height of elements on the page.\n\n\n## A concrete example\n\nThis is all fairly abstract, so here's some code to help. You can drop this into the Sandbox and compare the visual difference between the two `div` elements\\. If you run this code in the sandbox you will notice that the content of the first `div` has the exact same width as the entire second `div`. \n\n```markup\n<style>\n  strong {\n    display: block;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n  div {\n    background: white;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    margin-top: 20px;\n  }\n  .outer {\n    background: lightblue;\n    width: 300px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border: 5px solid tomato;\n  }\n  .border-box {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"outer\">\n  <div>\n    <h3>Standard Box Model</h3>\n    <p>\n      This div shows how the box model works by default.

          "content": "# What are margins?\n\n> A margin is the visual space between one HTML element and another.\n\nUsing margins you can move elements away from each other to create visual space. However, you can also do this with `padding` and `border` so let's look at the differences between the three concepts. \n\n## How is this difference with padding ?\n\n* Padding is the visual space between an elements _content_ and it's edges\n* In other words, `padding` is visual space within an element while `margin` is visual space around \\(outside\\) an element.\n\n\n## How does margin relate to border ?\n\n* The `border` is between an elements `margin` and `padding` , and it usually has a color applied to it.\n\n# Beware, margins will \"collapse\"\n\nThere's a trick margins do that might confuse you when you first come across it: Margins will _collapse\\. _\n\nWhat this means is:\n\n> If two margins touch each other, they will _not combine_ but instead will collapse in to each other. This means the visual margin will only be as big as the larger of the two, not the combination of the two.\n\nFor now it's enough to know that this quirk exists. There's no good way to learn about this quirk other than to have it bite you while building an application. \n# When should I use margins?\n\nGenerally, when you want to move one element away from another element. Some examples:\n\n* You have a navigation menu of links and you want space between them\n* You want space between paragraphs in a blog post\n   * Consider the space between the paragraphs you're reading right now. You could do that with margins.\n* When you want to center something on the page \\(see below\\)\n\n\nUsing margins for centering is a special use case, which might not be obvious but is extremely common.\n# Margin auto\n\nThere's a special value you can use for margins called `auto`. For example:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat `auto` does is it tells the browser to \\_auto\\_matically use as much space as possible given all other margins. So, what the code above does is it moves anything with the `.centered` class to the center of the page.\n\nAs with most CSS properties, `margin` has a shorthand syntax that is commonly used for centering something on the page:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis example is equivalent to the long\\-hand version:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n\n```\n"

          "content": "# Padding\n\nPadding means \"space inside\" of something. This is why we had you change some background colors in this challenge. Without a background color it's hard to tell where the padding is. Of course you don't always want to show how wide or slim something is, so it's up to you whether or not you use padding with a background or without.\n\nPadding without a background color can be used just like margin to separate things, however, visual space created by padding is only visual space. The element with padding itself becomes wider. This can be very useful for things like menus and buttons, where you want something to have a large clickable area even if the element itself isn't very large on screen.\n# The Display Property\n\nThe `display` property is very important in CSS. It determines how HTML elements interact with each other on the page. For example, `<a>` tags have a default display property of `inline`, which means other components can ignore their vertical padding. However, `inline-block` means their padding cannot be ignored, and you will get the results you see in this challenge.\n\nSome important display properties:\n\n* `display: block;` This is the default for most elements \\(`div`, `p`, `h1`, etc\\) and puts things on their own line.\n* `display: inline-block;` This is useful when you want things to line up horizontally \\(`a` tags in a horizontal menu for example\\) and you also want to add margins or padding.\n* `display: flex;` This is useful when you want child elements to expand or contract to fit available space. This display property is super flexible, and you might find yourself using it all the time once you know it.\n\n\nThese display properties will make up most of your UI. The web app you're using right now was built with only these display properties."

          "content": "Central to every TypeScript program is the data that it concerns, operates on, and manipulates. But what exactly is that data? How can it be described, and what are its properties?\n\nWell, TypeScript, like every programming language, has different _types_ of data. The number of types that can be created by a programming languageâ€™s users is infinite, however all languages, including TypeScript, have a set of built\\-in types, the lowest level of which are called **primitives**. These types can be operated on and manipulated by themselves, or be composed with other types to form more complex types, but this is a topic weâ€™ll cover in more detail later. For now, letâ€™s focus on TypeScript's most common **primitive data types**.\n\nFirst, though, letâ€™s clear something up. \n\n## What exactly is a type?\n\nAt its most basic, a type describes a particular piece of data. A piece of dataâ€™s type lets us \\(and more importantly, the TypeScript compiler\\!\\) know how this particular piece of data can be used and what kind of operations can be performed on it. For example, something with the type `number`, should be able to be added, subtracted, divided, and multiplied with other pieces of data that also have the type `number`. Makes sense, right\\!?\n\nIn fact, you just learned your first type: `number`\\! As you might have guessed, this is one of TypeScript's primitive data types; one of the basic building blocks of the data found within a TypeScript program.\n\n> **Tip**\n> A compiler is responsible for translating code written in one programming language into another language. In many cases, compilers are responsible for translating human\\-readable source code into something called machine\\-code, which is highly optimized and only intended to be interpreted by computers. In the case of TypeScript, the compiler is responsible for translating TypeScript into JavaScript that can be executed anywhere JavaScript can be.\n\n## TypeScript Primitive Types\n\nTypeScript supports several primitive data types, including:\n\n* `number`\n* `string`\n* `boolean`\n* `null`\n* `undefined`\n\n\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, for the purpose of the next several lessons, these are the types you'll need to know. Let's take a closer look at each one in the next few challenges."

In TypeScript, _`number`_ refers to the data type, while `Number` refers to the  __global__, and more concrete, `Number` object, a concept that goes beyond the scope of this lesson. For now, it's just important that you understand the distinction, and that TypeScript is a case\\-sensitive programming language. While this may seem like a small difference, remember: in the case of `number` vs\\. `Number`, case matters\\!\n\n## Just one number\n\nIn the challenge above, we discussed that data with the type `number` in TypeScript can represent both whole and fractional values. While it is not important in the context of this course, you might find it interesting to know that commonly, in other program languages, fractional values, or _floating point_ values, are represented by another data type.

However, as data types become more complex, or potentially ambiguous, it is sometimes useful to be more _explicit_, and tell the compiler exactly what type of data it's dealing with.

Type annotations are a way to tell the compiler what type of data to expect, and how to treat that data. \n\nThe syntax `:` \\+ `type name` is used to annotate variables and other parts of our programs. They look like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst name: string = \"Finn\"; \n// use a colon followed by a type to explicitly type something\n\n```\n\nThis is not always necessary, since TypeScript does have very powerful type inference, which goes far beyond inferring primitive data types.

This is the only type we've learned about so far which is not a valid type in TypeScript's subset language, JavaScript. This is because `any` is _just a type_,\\_ \\_and JavaScript is not a statically typed language like its superset, TypeScript.\n\nIn other words, `any` cannot be expressed literally. It is not a primitive type, and has no actual value that corresponds to it, the way that integer literals can be assigned to the `number` type, and string literals can be assigned to `string`. Rather, _all values_ can be assigned to `any`. \n\n```typescript\nconst quux: any = \"foo bar baz\";\nconst quuz: any = 70000;\nconst corg: any = true;\nconst flob: any = undefined;\nconst glob: any = null;\n\n```\n\n`any` is sort of like a type check escape hatch. It basically lets TypeScript know _not_ to **type check** something at compile\\-time \\(before the code is executed, i.e. statically\\).\n\n> **Tip**\n> Type checking is the process of validating and enforcing the type constraints in our code. Static type checking \\(such as in TypeScript\\), happens at compile\\-time, and helps to greatly reduce the occurrence of run\\-time errors in our code.\n\nUsing `any` can be extremely useful when we simply don't know the type of data something will be until run\\-time \\(when the code is actually executed\\). This might be because the data is coming from some external source that we don't have knowledge of beforehand, such as a program's end\\-user, or an external library. \n\nThat said, it is generally considered best practice to avoid using `any` wherever possible. This is because `any` makes our code less _type safe_: anything labeled as `any` will be type checked only at run\\-time \\(i.e. dynamically\\) and if there's a type mismatch, an error will be thrown, and your users' experience may impacted. \n\n> If `any` is overused, many of the benefits of using a statically typed language will be lost, and the incidence of run\\-time errors \\(something we always want to avoid\\!\\) is likely to increase. \n\nThe takeaway: use `any` sparingly, only when it is absolutely necessary."

          "content": "In our previous lessons, we've seen a lot of code that looks something like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst foo = 100;\n\n```\n\nLet's finally take a closer look at what's going on here.  \n\n## What is a Variable?\n\nIn this example, `foo`  is what's known as a variable. Variables store _references_ to data, or _values_, which we can use in our programs. Here, `foo`  is of the type `number` and has a value of `100`.  `100` is stored in memory, but the variable `foo` holds a reference to that memory, so it can be called up again and again, and used throughout the program. This is an important concept:\n\n> Variables store references to values stored in memory, and do not store the values themselves.\n\nIn TypeScript, to give meaning to a variable, it must be _declared_, _initialized_, and _assigned_ a value. Let's break this down.\n\n## Declaration & Initialization\n\nThroughout the next several lessons, we'll primarily be using they keywords `let`  and `const` to declare our variables. Each of these keywords has a slightly different behavior, which we'll explore in more detail later.\n\nThe syntax for variable declaration requires one of these keywords and an identifier, or name, to act as the variable's unique identifier.  When we declare a variable, it is automatically _initialized_, and memory is allocated for it. Once initialized, a variable will be `undefined` until we assign a value to it. \n\n```typescript\nlet baz; // baz is undefined\n\n```\n\n## Assignment\n\nThat's where the `=` operator comes in. Assignment is pretty intuitive: to the left of the `=` is the variable that we're assigning a value to \\(the left operand\\), and to the right of it is the value that we're assigning \\(the right operand\\).  In other words, the assignment operator gives the value of its right operand to its left operand. That's it\\!\n\nA variable can be declared and initialized first, and assigned a value later in the program. \n\n```typescript\nlet baz; // baz has been declared and intialized, and is undefined\n// do something...\nbaz = \"a string\"; // baz has been assigned a value\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, a variable can be declared, initialized, and given a value in a single statement.\n\n```typescript\nconst bar = \"cool!\"; // bar has been declared, initialized, and assigned a value\n\n```\n\nA quick note here: the process of assigning a variable a value for the first time \\(as in the above example\\) is also sometimes referred to as \"initialization\", since we're \"initializing\" the variable with a value. However, from a theoretical standpoint, true \"initialization\" happens when the variable is declared and the JavaScript engine \\(which ultimately runs all of our TypeScript code, since TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript before execution\\) allocates memory for it.\n\nWe're going to dive deeper into variables and assignment in the next few lessons.\n\nLet's go\\!"

In other words, if you assign the string `\"immutable\"` to a variable declared with `const`, you can always count on that variable being equal to the string `\"immutable\"`. Likewise, if you assign it a number, a boolean, null, or undefined. These types are immutable by nature, and values of these types cannot change over time \\(if a string or number appears to change over time, it is really a new instance of a string or number\\).\n\nFor more complex data types, though, `const` can trip you up if you're not careful. Check out the following examples using arrays:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // error! arr cannot be reassigned\n\n```\n\nLike you would expect, you cannot assign `arr` a new array \\(or any other value\\). However:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr.push(4);\n// here, .push(4) adds the number 4 to the end of the list\n// the list now equals [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n```\n\nAlthough we didn't assign `arr` a new value, its current value is different than the value we originally assigned to it. More precisely, the array that `arr` references has been _mutated_.\n\nWe will explore the concept of immutability more in future lessons, but for now, you should be aware that `const` only ensures that a variable cannot be reassigned, _not_ that the value it references is immutable."

          "content": "There are a few other arithmetic operators to be aware of. Let's take a quick look.\n\n## The Exponentiation Operator\n\nThe exponentiation or, `**`, operator raises the left\\-hand operand to the power of the right hand operand:\n\n```\nconst fourCubed = 4 ** 3; // 64\n\n```\n\n## The Unary Plus Operator\n\nThe unary plus, or `+`, operator, as its name suggests, only takes a single operand, and is used _prefix_, or immediately before its operand. Its only purpose is to convert its operand to a number \\(if it isn't one already\\) and return the result. Note that the operand itself _is not_ affected\\.\n\n```\nconst fiveAsString = \"5\";\nconst fiveAsNumber = +fiveAsString;\n// fiveAsString = \"5\", fiveAsNumber = 5\n\n```\n\nTry this out in the [sandbox](/workspace/sandbox) on more complex string representations of numbers \\(e.g. `\"-23543.0274\"`\\), and on values other than strings and see what you get\\! For instance, what do you expect the result to be when you use the unary plus operator on booleans or on `null`?\n\n```\nconst isTrue = true;\n+isTrue // ??\n\n```\n\nExperimentation and fun aside, It should be noted here, however, that there are other, more preferred ways to convert values to numbers in TypeScript. The unary plus operator is borderline esoteric, but will work just fine for simple use\\-cases. For more complex cases, other methods are preferred:\n\n```\nconst notReallyPi = \"3.14IsPie...err...ImeanPi\";\nconst definitelyNotPi = +notReallyPi; // NaN (not a number)\nconst pi = parseFloat(notReallyPi); // 3.14\n\n```\n\nThis example is obviously contrived, but you get the picture.\n\n## The Unary Negation Operator\n\nThe unary negation, or `-`, operator negates the value of its operand. If its operand is not a number, it also converts it to a number before negating it.\n\n```\nconst threeAsNumber = 3;\nconst threeAsString = \"3\";\n-threeAsString; // -3\n-threeAsNumber; // -3\n\n```\n"
