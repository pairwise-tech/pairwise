Together, they give you a complete education in full\\-stack software development. Pairwise can give you all the skills to start a new career in software development. Our curriculum focuses on teaching **TypeScript, React, **and** NodeJS**. If you are curious more about why we chose these technologies, feel free to [read our rationale here](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum) or [watch this video](/workspace/7j8@a2tVR).\n\nYou can access the course navigation by clicking the menu icon in the top left. This is always available for you to navigate to any challenge or module.\n\nThe first two modules introduce HTML/CSS and TypeScript, so they cover many of the basics of web development and programming. These two modules are completely free and no signup is required\\! However, you can create an account at any time \\(also free\\!\\) to track your progress \\(don't worry, we will track your progress even if you don't have an account yet\\).\n\nIf you do decide to continue and complete the entire course, there will be a one\\-time payment which will give you lifetime access to the course. You can make this payment with a credit card at anytime after signing up.\n\nThe primary mode of learning is through short, interactive coding challenges like the one you just solved. If you persist through the entire course, you will also build up a portfolio of projects you build and deploy on your own\\! You can use this portfolio as a showcase of your skills to future employers.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nEnough talking\\! To start learning you just need to start on the next challenge. Each challenge should just take 5\\-10 minutes to complete and will be simple and interactive just like the last. We know you're eager to click that **Next Challenge** button, but before you do we encourage you to watch this short video tutorial of how to use the _Pairwise Workspace_. It will give you some helpful tips which will help you get started, and after that we'll get out of your way\\! Good luck and welcome\\!\n\n> If you want to stay up to date with changes and additions to the Pairwise course, feel free to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PairwiseTech) where we will post frequent product updates.\n"

          "content": "HTML is the reason there is anything online to look at. It's ubiquitous online because without it there would be nothing. When you visit Facebook or Google or Reddit you're reading HTML. You're reading HTML right now.\n# What is HTML?\n\nHTML is a language for putting content into web browsers and telling browsers what content means what. Consider the following items:\n\n* Some plain text\n* Some _bold italic_ text\n* Some `code` text\n\n\nIt's easy to tell the difference and that's the point. Different parts of a webpage mean different things, and as programmers we need a way of telling a web browser what's what.\n\nLet's take another example. Consider the list above. Howe does the browser know that its' a list? How does it know to include a small dot in front of the text? The answer is HTML. \n\nConsider what that three\\-item list looks like to you, the reader, and also consider what it looks like in code:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li>Some plain text</li>\n  <li>\n    Some <strong><em>bold italic</em></strong> text\n  </li>\n  <li>Some <code>code</code> text</li>\n</ul>\n\n```\n\nIt looks quite different\\! The code above is what the browser sees. A `ul` with some `li`s inside tell the browser we want a list. Putting some text inside a `strong` and an `em` will make the text **bold** and _italic_ respectively\\. \n# Why are we learning HTML?\n\nA few reasons: \n\n* It's visual\n* It gives you real skills, quickly\n* It's foundational\n\n\nHere's what this in more detail.\n\n## 1\\. It's visual\n\nWhat you write in code will appear on screen. This is hugely important when you're first learning. Programmers specialize in telling computers what to do, and computers don't always give you visual feedback to let you know that your commands are achieving the desired result.\n\nThink about the clock on your phone. Seem simple right? It shows the time. It also adjusts for daylight savings time, or if you physically enter a different timezone. It can display the time in 24\\-hour format or AM\\-PM format. Consider this:\n\n* How does your phone know the time? \n* How does the clock update when daylight savings time shifts or when you step off of a plan? \n\n\nThis functionality, which we all take for granted, was programmed by someone. Imagine you are that person. If you program the phone to update its time based on your GPS location, how do you know it worked? There's no immediate visual feedback to tell you whether your code worked or not.\n\nIf you're writing HTML there is visual feedback, so you will know immediately if your code is doing what you want it to.\n\n## 2\\. It gives you real skills, quickly\n\nIf you learn the basics of HTML, guess what? You can make your own website. In fact, in this course we'll walk you through creating a website from scratch and getting it online for free. \n\nAt the end of this module you will be able to build something real, that you can see online and show to other people. In fact, using just the skills in this first module you can even build websites for other people and **get paid to do it**. There are many people around the world who make a living this way. \n\nOf course our goal is to give you the skills to be a full software engineer so we will go well beyond HTML. Which brings us to the final point...\n\n## 3\\. It's foundational\n\nHTML is everywhere, and not just on the web.\n\nConsider Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc. These massive companies all rely on HTML. They all have mobile apps too, but the web component is a significant part of their business.\n\nConsider also that the principles you learn while building HTML can translate into mobile app development as well. We will touch on this significantly in later parts of the course. For now, let's focus on HTML and dive in.\n# HTML Syntax\n\n\n## Tags\n\nAll those things you saw in the code at the beginning of the lesson, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, etc. are called tags. Don't worry, you don't have to remember this yet, but you will over time because this is how programmers talk about HTML and how we walk about it in our videos. \n\n### Anatomy of an HTML tag\n\nTags usually have two parts:\n\n* The opening tag\n* The closing tag\n\nOpening tags include a `<` symbol, followed by the name of the tag, followed by the `>` symbol\\. Closing tags are almost exactly the same. The only difference is that closing tags have a `/` symbol right after the `<`. Example:\n\n* `<p>I'm a paragraph</p>`\n\n\nReading through one character at a time, the opening \"P tag\" is `<` \\+ `p` \\+ `>`. The closing P tag is `<` \\+ `/` \\+ `p` \\+ `>`. You can use this rule for every tag you write. \n\nHere are a few more examples. Try to see the pattern of opening `<` \\+ tag name \\+ `>` and closing `</` \\+ tag name \\+ `>`.\n\n* `<a>Link</a>`\n* `<button>Click me</button>`\n* `<h1>Heading text</h1>`\n\n\n### Self\\-closing tags\n\nNot all tags have to correspond to a closing tags. Sometimes it wouldn't make sense to have any text inside the tag. For example, a `<p>` means a paragraph so you would expect some text inside. However, an `<img>` tag means an image and a `<video>` means a video. When you see one of these tags the browser knows to show the actual image or the actual video that the tag corresponds to, so there is no need to write additional text inside the tag. This is also true of input fields, where you can type things in to a webpage. Ever logged in to a site? Yeah, like that.\n\nHere are some common tags that are self\\-closing. \n\n* `<img />`\n* `<video />`\n* `<input />`\n\n\nNotice the syntax here. It's like the opening tag and closing tag got smushed together because there's nothing in between:\n\n* `<img></img>` becomes `<img />`\n* `<video></video>` becomes `<video />`\n* `<input></input>` becomes `<input />`\n\n\n## Properties\n\nThe final piece before we dive in to some code\\! Properties tell the browser things about the tag itself. This will become more clear with examples. Consider the `<img />` tag mentioned above. That points to an image, but how does the browser now what image? With a property.\n\n```markup\n<img src=\"https://placekitten.com/g/200/200\" />\n\n```\n\nThe key above is the `src` property\\. The syntax for properties looks like: property name \\+ `=` \\+ `\"` \\+ property value \\+ `\"`. All of this goes inside the opening tag, which is the only tag if it's self\\-closing like the `<img />` above\\.\n\nNow consider another example, perhaps the single most important property in all of HTML. The `href`:\n\n```markup\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/\">Don't click me if you value your time...</a>\n\n```\n\nThe `a` tag is the \"link\" on the web. It's what you click when after searching for something, or when shopping, or when doing research. It's a fundamental part of the web. Web pages include `a` tags which link to other pages. Without links the internet would just be a bunch of disperate web pages that you had to visit directly by typing the address into your browser. OK, back on topic.\n\nThe `href` property of the `a` tag tells the browser where to send someone when they click the link. \n\nThese examples are just meant to be an overview, in the coming challenges you'll use all these tags directly. There's no substitute for hands\\-on practice. Onward\\!"

We have covered headings and paragraphs for rendering text, inputs, forms, and buttons for capturing user input and creating interactions, and spans and divs for adding structure and layout to your HTML pages.\n\nThe tags you have learned constitute the most commonly used HTML tags and a knowledge of them will get you very far. If you are interested, take a look at the [MDN HTML reference page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) for a more exhaustive list of all of the HTML tags which exist. There's no need to memorize all of these, but a brief overview should help paint a picture of all of the different elements HTML has to offer.\n\n### Styles with CSS\n\nThe next section will introduce CSS, which will build upon your current HTML skills to start adding life and color to your HTML document. CSS allows you to color and shape HTML elements to create custom appearances and layouts for your webpages.\n\nWith HTML and CSS, you can create beautiful webpages but to really transform them into functional web applications you need a programming language.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is the programming language of the web. All web browsers can run JavaScript programs, and any functionality you use on websites is typically built using JavaScript. Once you complete the CSS section, the next course module will be a deep dive into programming with a special dialect of JavaScript, _TypeScript\\._\n\nTypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to JavaScript. Don't worry about the details here yet: we will cover them in depth once we get to the TypeScript section. This programming section will lay the foundation for everything which comes later.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nAfter the TypeScript module, we will have covered the foundations of HTML/CSS and programming. You will understand the basics of how webpages are made and you will have a thorough grasp of a modern programming language.\n\nFrom there, the course will get into the modern skills, tools, and workflows software engineers use to build complex applications, servers, and mobile apps. There's a lot to learn, but as you will see all of this is built on the basic foundation you are learning now\\!\n\nLet's continue\\!"

          "content": "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, but that's unimportant. What matters here is that what CSS is how you change the way things _look_ on the web.\n\nWhere HTML is the \"stuff\", the actual content on a webpage, CSS is how all that stuff looks. Is the background dark with light text \\(like what you're reading right now\\)? Is there a menu bar near the top? How does the form on screen try to grab your attention with color and positioning? These are all questions CSS can answer.\n\nTo be specific, CSS tells the browser two things:\n\n* What we want to style\n* What we want it to look like\n\n# Selectors\n\nSelectors tell the browser what you want to style.\n\nFor example, you might say to yourself \"I want all the paragraphs on my site to be red\\!\" A very elegant design decision. In order to communicate this to the browser we can use CSS:\n\n```css\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n```\n\nRemember the `<p>` tag from earlier lessons? Using the tagname, `p`, we were able to \"select\" every paragraph on the page and make them all red. In this example `p` is the selector. Now let's talk about what's inside those brackets.\n# Properties\n\nCSS properties tell the browser how you want something to look. Let's say you're tired of drab white\\-background websites and want to mix it up with a `teal` background\\.\n\n```css\nbody {\n  background: teal;\n}\n\n```\n\n`body` will select the entire visible area of the web page, but we will touch on that more later. Focus on `background: teal;`. Here we have another CSS property `background` with a value of `teal`.\n\n> CSS properties take the form: property name \\+ `:` \\+ property value \\+ `;`.\n\n`background` and `color` are just two examples. There are quite a few CSS properties you can use, and the combination of them is responsible for styling every site you use on the internet.\n\nIf you're curious you can skim through [the full list of CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference), but we don't recommend it. It's a very dry read and by itself won't tell you what you really want to know which is what each property does. Furthermore, some CSS properties are so obscure that you can go your entire career without learning them on the job because they are just not useful in most context.\n# Blocks\n\nA \"block\" of CSS is simply the combination of selectors and properties. All the examples above are CSS blocks.\n\n> CSS blocks take the form: Selectors \\+ `{` \\+ properties \\+ `}`\n\nThese terms are not important for their own sake, but so that you aren't lost when you're working outside of this course. \n# The <style\\> tag connects HTML and CSS\n\nYou can't just write CSS anywhere in an HTML document and expect it to work. You have to write it **within a \\*\\***`style`**\\*\\* tag**. Like this:\n\n```html\n<style>\n  p { color: red; }\n</style>\n<p>Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nIf you write that without the `style` tag the browser will literally put `p { color: red; }` on the page for everyone to see. By putting that CSS code within a `style` tag you are telling the browser to treat it as CSS rather than HTML.\n# Specificity and the HTML class and id props\n\nImagine you have two paragraphs, and you want one to be `red` and the other to be `blue`. How would you select just one? Here's the HTML:\n\n```html\n<p>I want a blue background</p>\n<p>I want a red background</p>\n\n```\n\nYou might try the following CSS:\n\n```\np { background: red; }\np { background: blue; }\n\n```\n\nHowever, both paragraphs will be `blue`\\! Why? Two things are happening here:\n\n1. `p` selects every `<p>` tag, not just the first or the second.\n1. When you have two identical selectors \\(`p` and `p` above\\) and two identical property names \\(`background` and `background` above\\) whichever one comes last wins.\n\nPoint 1 can be addressed with IDs and classes, which we will discuss shortly.\n\nPoint 2, how conflicting styles get applied by the browser, is called \"specificity\". As in, the second CSS block is considered more _specific_ than the first, and therefore it wins and gets applied.\n\n## IDs\n\nAn ID is a unique identifier in the browser and it can be used as a selector. \n\n* There should only be 1 of any ID on a web page.\n* IDs are very specific, meaning if you select an ID in your CSS that CSS will most likely win over other styles\n* HTML uses the `id` property, CSS uses the `#` selector\\.\n\n\n```html\n<style>\n  #my-paragraph { color: red; }\n  p { color: blue; }\n</style>\n<p id=\"my-paragraph\">Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nEven though the `p` styles come last, the `#my-paragraph` styles get applied because they are more specific.\n\n> In general don't use IDs, use classes.\n\n## Classes\n\n* A class can be applied to as many things as you want.\n* Classes are more specific than tag names\n* HTML uses the `class` property, CSS uses the `.` selector\\.\n\n\n```markup\n<style>\n  .red-text { color: red; }\n  p { color: blue; }\n</style>\n<p class=\"red-text\">Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nThe text is again red because classes are more specific than tag names.\n\n> Classes are extremely useful and flexible. Use them a lot.\n# More to come...\n\nThat's a lot of information, and mostly meaningless without practice. There's more to CSS which we will dive into later, but for now let's practice everything we just talked about."

The most simple is what we've been doing so far, which is using colors that have names like `blue`, `red`, `black`, `green`, etc. However, if you had to rely on colors that have names you would be quite limited. HTML let's you define any custom color you want using some different syntax, namely HEX codes. For example, the color `white` can also be written `#ffffff`. Likewise `black` is `#000000` and `blue` is `#0000ff`. \n\nIn the meantime you can use named colors. There are quite a few, and often if you guess a color it will exist.

          "content": "I'm no fan of jargon, but sometimes you just gotta learn it. The \"box model\" is one such case. It's vital to being fluent in CSS.\n# What is the box model?\n\nThe official [CSS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) gives a nice overview:\n\n> Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.\n\nTo put this another way, **the box model is how elements are visually arranged on a web page.** \n\nNow let's get a bit more concrete. There are a number of CSS properties that fall under the banner of the box model:\n\n* `width` and `height`: How wide or tall an element is.\n* `margin`: Visual space between elements.\n* `padding`: Visual space between an element's edge and its content.\n* `border`: Space around an element between its `margin` and `padding`. \n* `display`: How an element interacts with other elements on the page. \n\n\nLet's look at each property in a bit more detail.\n\n## Width and height\n\nThese properties are pretty straight forward. You can make can control how wide an element is using the `width` property\\. You can control how tall an element is using the `height` property\\. Simple... mostly.\n\nWhat can be confusing is that elements in a webpage all have _defaults_, meaning they will have a certain width or height even if you don't assign any. This is a good thing.\n\nHere's an image of a cat:\n\n\n![The standard width and height of the cat image.](/assets/B1LBriGU/3c36a842b67ee20197dc4611dd5e1cfa_cat.png)\n\nI didn't give it a `width` or a `height` yet, so what is it doing? By default an image in HTML will automatically have the width of the image. Every photo has a width and the browser will use that width by default. Same for the height.\n\nNow let's completely ignore that width and set our own.\n\n![Width is about double, while height is unchanged.](/assets/B1LBriGU/003a902631059ac5fb26f9d406930b91_cat-wide.png)\n\nAs you can see, this is not at all what you want, but it shows what using the width property can do. Height works in the same way.\n\n## Margin\n\nMargins are space between things. A common example is the space between paragraphs. Imagine the page you're reading right now if there was no visual separation between paragraphs. It would not be very readable.\n\n### Margins Collapse\n\nIf you have two margins next to each other they will collapse into each other. In other words the total visual space created will **not** be the sum of the margins but actually just the larger of the two. Let's say we have two elements with two classes and they are right next to each other in our HTML:\n\n```markup\n<style>\n    .a { margin-bottom: 10px }\n    .b { margin-top: 20px; }\n</style>\n<div class=\"a\">Div A</div>\n<div class=\"b\">Div B</div>\n\n```\n\nHow much space will there be between `.a` and `.b` on the page? **20px**\\! Not 30px, which would be the total of margins from both elements.\n\n## Padding\n\nPadding is space within an element. You can also think of this like space around its content. Let's look at an example. Here's Google's search UI at the time of writing:\n\n\n![](/assets/B1LBriGU/ca1f80839c0c0d88ee0da11ddd682fa4_goog.png)\nLet's focus specifically on those buttons. They have padding. Look at the amount of space _within_ each button. The text doesn't push up against the edge of the gray button background. \n\nHere's the same UI, but I've removed the padding from the buttons:\n\n![](/assets/B1LBriGU/19d43f243d639489d98bd3dd99630381_goog-no-adding.png)\nYou can barely tell the buttons have a gray background now\\! There is no space between the text of the buttons—the button content—and the edge of the button background.\n\nPadding does not collapse. If you have two elements with padding next to each other the visual space will be the total. Here's the same example from the margin section, but using padding.\n\n```markup\n<style>\n    .a { padding-bottom: 10px }\n    .b { padding-top: 20px; }\n</style>\n<div class=\"a\">Div A</div>\n<div class=\"b\">Div B</div>\n\n```\n\nHow much space will there be between `.a` and `.b` on the page? 30px.\n\n## Border\n\nBorder is pretty simple. It lets you add borders to elements. To be more specific, it lets you create space between an element's `margin` and `padding`. Let's keep on going with the example above. I'm going to remove the border around the Google search bar.\n\n![The Google search bar. The padding around the lower buttons is still removed.](/assets/B1LBriGU/19d43f243d639489d98bd3dd99630381_goog-no-adding.png)\n\n![The same google search bar, with one-line of CSS changed. What a difference!](/assets/B1LBriGU/2d7734fe0547fabff03f478dca4dcafb_goog-no-border.png)\n\nLook at the difference\\! With just a single border you can go from a search bar to a few disparate items on a page.\n\n## The display property\n\nThe `display` property determines how an element is displayed with relation to other elements. I know—not a very helpful description. This property makes the most sense once we've solidified your knowledge of the other box model properties so we will revisit it in [another challenge](/workspace/s8be1H0U). \n# Box Sizing\n\nCSS is tricky. The good news is developers used to have it _much worse_ than we do. Let me explain.\n\nWhen you set a `width` or a `height` in CSS you probably expect the selected element to have that exact width or height. This is a reasonable assumption—but it's wrong. _By default_ the visual size of an element—how large it looks to your eyes on screen—would be calculated as: `width` or `height` \\+ `margin` \\+ `border` \\+ `padding`. \n\nDoes that make sense? When you say `width: 300px` you generally expect the element to be `300px` wide, rather than `300px` \\+ padding, border and margins. \n\nDevelopers in the past had to be constantly doing math in their heads to figure out how much padding, border and margin to apply to get the width they wanted. ++No more\\!++ As I've been alluding to, these days there's a better way.\n\n```css\n* { box-sizing: border-box; }\n\n```\n\n## The first line of all your CSS\n\nThis bit of CSS is so useful i'm just going to repeated it again:\n\n```css\n* { box-sizing: border-box; }\n\n```\n\nWhat is this line doing?\n\n* `*` is selecting **everything** on the page. Every element. It's a special selector for exactly this purpose.\n* `box-sizing: border-box` Tells the browser that we want the `width` and `height` properties to determine the _visual_ width and _visual_ height of elements on the page.\n\n\nIn other words, when you say `width: 300px` you get 300 pixels of visual width. The thing to keep in mind is that if you do this your content might grow or shrink.\n\n## A concrete example\n\nWe're going to look at this again in the [box\\-sizing challenge](/workspace/nel5ggJ1), so don't worry. There's a hands\\-on exercise coming up.\n\nBox sizing is fairly abstract, so here's some code to help. You can drop this into the Sandbox and compare the visual difference between the two `div` elements\\. If you run this code in the sandbox you will notice that the content of the first `div` has the exact same width as the entire second `div`. \n\n```markup\n<style>\n  strong {\n    display: block;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n  div {\n    background: white;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    margin-top: 20px;\n  }\n  .outer {\n    background: lightblue;\n    width: 300px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border: 5px solid tomato;\n  }\n  .border-box {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"outer\">\n  <div>\n    <h3>Standard Box Model</h3>\n    <p>\n      This div shows how the box model works by default.

          "content": "# What are margins?\n\n> A margin is the visual space between one HTML element and another.\n\nUsing margins you can move elements away from each other to create visual space. However, you can also do this with `padding` and `border` so let's look at the differences between the three concepts. \n\n## How is this difference with padding ?\n\n* Padding is the visual space between an elements _content_ and it's edges\n* In other words, `padding` is visual space within an element while `margin` is visual space around \\(outside\\) an element.\n\n\n## How does margin relate to border ?\n\n* The `border` is between an elements `margin` and `padding` , and it usually has a color applied to it.\n\n# Beware, margins will \"collapse\"\n\nThere's a trick margins do that might confuse you when you first come across it: Margins will _collapse\\. _\n\nWhat this means is:\n\n> If two margins touch each other, they will _not combine_ but instead will collapse in to each other. This means the visual margin will only be as big as the larger of the two, not the combination of the two.\n\nFor now it's enough to know that this quirk exists. There's no good way to learn about this quirk other than to have it bite you while building an application. \n# When should I use margins?\n\nGenerally, when you want to move one element away from another element. Some examples:\n\n* You have a navigation menu of links and you want space between them\n* You want space between paragraphs in a blog post\n   * Consider the space between the paragraphs you're reading right now. You could do that with margins.\n* When you want to center something on the page \\(see below\\)\n\n\nUsing margins for centering is a special use case, which might not be obvious but is extremely common.\n# Margin auto\n\nThere's a special value you can use for margins called `auto`. For example:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat `auto` does is it tells the browser to \\_auto\\_matically use as much space as possible given all other margins. So, what the code above does is it moves anything with the `.centered` class to the center of the page.\n\nAs with most CSS properties, `margin` has a shorthand syntax that is commonly used for centering something on the page:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis example is equivalent to the long\\-hand version:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n\n```\n"

          "content": "# Padding\n\nPadding means \"space inside\" of something. This is why we had you change some background colors in this challenge. Without a background color it's hard to tell where the padding is. Of course you don't always want to show how wide or slim something is, so it's up to you whether or not you use padding with a background or without.\n\nPadding without a background color can be used just like margin to separate things, however, visual space created by padding is only visual space. The element with padding itself becomes wider. This can be very useful for things like menus and buttons, where you want something to have a large clickable area even if the element itself isn't very large on screen.\n# The Display Property\n\nThe `display` property is very important in CSS. It determines how HTML elements interact with each other on the page. For example, `<a>` tags have a default display property of `inline`, which means other components can ignore their vertical padding. However, `inline-block` means their padding cannot be ignored, and you will get the results you see in this challenge.\n\nSome important display properties:\n\n* `display: block;` This is the default for most elements \\(`div`, `p`, `h1`, etc\\) and puts things on their own line.\n* `display: inline-block;` This is useful when you want things to line up horizontally \\(`a` tags in a horizontal menu for example\\) and you also want to add margins or padding.\n* `display: flex;` This is useful when you want child elements to expand or contract to fit available space. This display property is super flexible, and you might find yourself using it all the time once you know it.\n\n\nThese display properties will make up most of your UI. The web app you're using right now was built with only these display properties."

In the next few challenges we'll dive into some of the more confusing _and_ useful CSS properties. You already saw some of this when we [talked about `box-sizing`](/workspace/nel5ggJ1), but there's yet more to cover. \n\nFun topics to come include:\n\n* Positioning \\(including the interesting `content` property\\)\n* More `display` property\n* Transforms\n\n# Why?\n\nSome of this stuff is bound to be fairly confusing at first and we take our content selection very seriously. So is it really that important? \n\n++Yes\\.++\n\nThe techniques we'll cover are extremely potent for creating _layouts_, which is the most confounding aspect of CSS. Almost everyone who has complained about any aspect of CSS ran into issues with their layout and spent entirely too long figuring out how to fix it. I would know, I've been that person—Everyone on the Pairwise team has in fact. \n\n> **Layouts vs Styling**\n> Layouts can be time consuming and frustrating to create when you don't know what you're doing. Styling, on the other hand, is quite straightforward.

          "content": "# An introduction to positioning\n\nIn CSS the `position` property has a lot of power, but it's not necessarily clear how it works. There are three main positioning properties we're going to look at:\n\n* `position: relative;` That's what you were working with in this challenge.\n* `position: absolute;` More interesting than `relative` but you need them both together.\n* `position: fixed;` Very useful or annoying depending on your opinion. This is how websites \"fix\" a header or footer to the window as you scroll. If you've ever been on a cramped mobile site and the header would not leave you alone it's probably because of this CSS property.\n\n\nThere's also `position: static;`, which is the default for all elements. This means you won't see this property very often because it's always there unless you change it. Setting a `position` property on an element to **anything other than static** will make it \"positioned.\"\n# What does this property let me do?\n\nIt lets you pick up an element and move it wherever you want relative to some other element.\n\nOnce you are using a position property you gain access to four new properties which let you control the location of an element on the page: `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```css\n.rel {\n    position: relative;\n    top: 20px;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis will visually move an element down by `20px`.\n\nThere are other challenges for `absolute` and `fixed` so let's talk about position `relative` first\\.\n# Relative to what?\n\nThis is one of those unintuitive properties in CSS. Relative positioning moves an element ++relative to itself++. That means, in the example above, the `.rel` element would be moved `20px` lower on the page than its initial position.\n# What does this let me do?\n\n* By far the most common use case of `position: relative;` is to set an element as an anchor for another element using `position: absolute;` which we'll cover in the next challenge.\n* You can use relative positioning to \"nudge\" elements into the position you want.\n   * Sometimes your layout just won't cooperate. You can use relative positioning to cheat and force your element in a direction.\n   * I say \"nudge\" because if you're doing more significant repositioning you might want absolute positioning instead.\n\n# Relative and absolute\n\nI said we'd hold off on `position: absolute;` until another challenge but there's something we need to mention first: ++Absolute positioning and relative positioning need to work together to be effective++.\n\nWhen you use `positionn: absolute;` you are positioning an element _relative to the nearest parent element with_ `position: relative;`. \n\nIf that sounds confusing, don't worry—it is. It's best understood through examples and practice, so let's keep learning.\n# Resources\n\n* [Official documentation on relative positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Relative_positioning)\n\n"

          "content": "Hopefully you got the code above to look something like this:\n\n![Look at all those labels! 🏷](/assets/$TscTvcd/a988dc3acf3622a900b2e072b425fc8c_abs-positioning-1.png)\n\nThis is the power of absolute positioning: You can position one element relative to another. In this example we positioned the `.label` elements in the upper\\-right of their parent elements.\n\nThe key is, the parent element has to have a position. Usually, this position is `position: relative;` because we don't want the parent to reposition itself, just serve as an anchor for the child element.\n\n> \n> ### The DOM Family Tree\n> \n> \\(if you're wondering what the DOM is, [here's a link to our that challenge](/workspace/C$3mo2yQ)\\)\n> \n> Programmers needed words to talk about the relationships between elements in the DOM and they understood that the DOM is a tree—much like a family tree. So when we talk about the DOM we use words you've heard many times before, but in a different context.\n> \n> **Parents:** When talking about the DOM we use the words \"parent\" or \"ancestor\" to refer to any element higher up in the tree.\n> **Siblings:** Any element at the same level in the tree. If you have three `a` tags inside a `div` the links are all siblings to each other. The `div` is their parent.\n> **Children: **Any element lower in the tree. Children are easy to identify in code because they are within another element.\n# DOM relationships and position absolute\n\nThe short version is: `position: absolute;` will position an element _relative to its nearest ancestor_ ++with a position++. Remember, for an element to be \"positioned\" it must have the position property set to either `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`.\n\nIf the element has no positioned ancestors then it will be relative to the `body` tag\\. This is what is happening in this challenge when you first load it up. You will see the `.label` elements displaying in the upper\\-right of_ the _`body` as opposed to their parent element.\n# A simple recipe\n\nLet's say you have two divs, `div.a` and `div.b`. If you want to display `div.a` relative to `div.b` do this:\n\n* Make sure `div.a` is inside `div.b`, in other words `div.b` is the parent of `div.a`.\n* Set `position: relative;` on `div.b` \\(The parent div\\).\n* Set `position: absolute;` on `div.a` \\(The child div\\).\n\n\nThen you can use the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right` properties to move `div.a` anywhere you want relative to `div.b`.\n# When would you use this?\n\n* You want to display a badge of some sort, like an unread count on an email app.\n   * You can see an example of this in this challenge.\n* You want some sort of custom border or edge to your element.\n   * You can see an example of this in the Pairwise navigation menu. Whenever you hover one of the challenge names it gets a \"border\" which is actually an absolutely positioned element, not a the `border` property\\.\n* When you want something to stretch to fit inside another element.\n   * This is a result of combinations of the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right` properties\\. We'll revisit this later.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Official Absolute Positioning Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Absolute_positioning)\n   * Just in case you're curious there are more examples in the official docs.\n\n"

          "content": "Let's revisit the display property. There are several values you should be familiar with.\n\n```css\n.inline-block { display: inline-block; }\n.block { display: block; }\n.flex { display: flex; }\n.table { display: table; }\n\n```\n# Display Properties\n\nSetting `display` on an element let's you play around with how it interacts with other elements on the page. For example, `display: inline-block;` tells an element to flow \"in line\" with other inline elements but also to allow setting margins and padding. Setting `display: flex;` will tell an element reposition it's children in a row \\(or column\\).\n\nWe'll go through the key display properties one by one.\n\n## Inline Block\n\n```css\ndiv { display: inline-block; }\n\n```\n\nBy default many inline elements have unintuitive ways of handling margins and padding. It's often a good idea to apply  `display: inline-block;` to inline elements just so you don't bang your head against a wall for an hour trying to figure out why your `padding` isn't acting the way you expect.\n\n### Uses\n\n* You want to apply `margin` or `padding` to some inline element \\(`span` for example, or `a`\\).\n\n\n## Block\n\n```css\ndiv { display: block; }\n\n```\n\nThis is the default for most elements, so even if you want to make use of it you don't need to write it out explicitly. \n\n### Uses\n\n* Where display block can be more interesting is where you want an inline item to act like a block. Use `display: block;` on `a` tags to make a vertical nav menu.\n* Automatically size to take up all available width.\n\n\n## Flex\n\n```css\ndiv { display: flex; }\n\n```\n\n### Uses\n\n* Everything\\! \\(ok, not literally, but _almost_ everything\\).\n* Center items vertically, horizontally, or both.\n* Tell elements to take up \"Whatever space is left\" once other siblings are accounted for.\n* Space elements vertically or horizontally. You can justify them, clump them, put space between, etc.\n\n\nFlexbox is extremely \\_flex\\_ible, no pun intended \\(seriously\\). It's a workhorse for creating all sorts of layouts. If you're ever unsure how to get some layout you want, flexbox is often the answer.\n\nThat being said, there's a lot to learn and you won't use most of it very often. So focus on these properties:\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex; /* Of course */\n\n/* \n  You can control how elements grow or shrink to take advantage of space */\nflex: 1 100%;\n\n/* \n  Once you have a display: flex; on an element, use align-items and justify-content \n  to control how its children arrange themselves. */\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center; /* Also try: space-between, space-around, flex-end */\n\n```\n\n## Table\n\n```css\ndiv { display: table; }\n\n```\n\nIn all honesty you won't use this much. However, it does have one specific use case which you may find quite useful.\n\n### Uses\n\n* Tell an element to take up only as much spaces as needed, but otherwise behave like `block`.\n\n\nBy default any element with `display: block;` will stretch to be as wide as possible. You can assign a `width` property, `width: 500px;` for example, but that requires being specific about the width. What if you want to say \"Be as wide as you need to be, but no wider.\"? That's what display table lets you do."

Here's what I mean:\n\n* Challenges give you extremely valuable practice with concepts.\n* However, projects are where you get to apply those concepts on your own. \n\n\nYou won't really know something until you've been stuck without an answer wondering how to write some code. The key is you already know some, so you're not helpless. \n\nThe Pairwise projects will all be real world projects for you to complete. The projects will always be paired with \"Guided Projects\", which are walkthrough examples of how to complete the projects. The goal is for you to try to complete the project fully on your own, but if you struggle \\(or succeed\\) to use the guided project as an example tutorial of how to complete the projects. Later in the course, the guided projects will not directly mirror the actual project \\- they will just be an example which requires a similar application of the required skills.\n\nFor this module and the next module \\(TypeScript\\), the guided projects are actual solutions to the projects. This is to help you get off the ground in these early modules.\n\nEven if you feel these projects are well within your wheelhouse we'd still recommend skimming the videos as we cover some new topics that didn't warrant their own section.\n\n> The projects are **not** ordered\\. You can complete them in whatever order works best for you.\n# How to use these projects\n\n1. Choose a project.\n1. Read through the instructions.\n1. Try to complete the project on your own \\(even if you just give it 20 minutes, try on your own\\).\n1. Build the project using the Pairwise Sandbox \\(link in the top right of the header\\).\n1. Once you have completed the project, download the project file \\(you will need this later to deploy the project\\).\n1. Feel free to review the guided project walkthrough \\(next section\\) which provides a full video tutorial for how to complete these projects.\n\n\nThese projects put your HTML & CSS skills to the test in the real world building webpages and actual UIs. For now, these do not have a lot of functionality, but they provide the foundation for bringing your own project ideas to life. As you will see, some of the later course projects will build on these to create full, working applications.\n\nLater in the course \\(in the Developer Workflow module\\), we will teach you how to develop websites on your own computer, manage your code with version control and GitHub, and deploy your websites for the world to see. At that stage, you can deploy all of the projects you build here \\(and add them to your portfolio\\).\n# What's to Come\n\nThe next module after this is the TypeScript module, where we provide a deep dive straight into programming. That module will provide the groundwork for developing software applications. After that, the real course begins: we will teach you the workflow and tools for a software engineer and then start to introduce the libraries, frameworks, and practices teams use to build and deploy real world apps. In those modules, you will build many projects which are real, practical applications."

The styling part is subjective—no wrong answers here. The goal is just to make something you would be happy to put online, perhaps at `YOUR-NAME.com` or some similar domain.\n# What's the point?\n\nThere are more than one aspects to this challenge, but above all remember that challenges are here to help you get _practice_. ++The more repetitions complete with a given task the better you will be.++ If you write 1000 webpages and put them online you will be pretty good at creating websites, considerably better than someone who's only created one or two.\n\nWith that being said, there is an additional point to this exercise:\n\n* **Create something real**. A website is something real and tangible which you can show to the world.\n\n# Resources\n\n* The [System Fonts Guide in Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/system-fonts.html)\n   * If you're wondering about fonts and how to know what fonts work by default without adding any external resources.\n   * Author's note: That site is an amazing resource for all things related to typography. Highly recommended.\n\n"

This project demonstrates coding a UI that works well in that context.\n* Building layouts based on _constraints_ is a key skill and it's better to learn through doing.\n* If you can build a an interface like the one in this challenge you've reached a professional level. There is _much_ more covered in the course but even at this point if you've mastered this module you know enough that someone would pay you to create websites.\n\n\n## Why not build a mobile app?\n\nYou absolute _can_ build a mobile app if that suits your needs, and we'll be diving deep into mobile in the Mobile module. For now, the purpose of this challenge is to get you more experience using the CSS concepts covered in this module and to show you what it's like to build a more full UI rather than just a bit of challenge code.\n\nBuilding mobile apps is significantly move involved than building for the web, and will involve many concepts we haven't touched on yet at this point in the course including:\n\n* TypeScript\n* React\n* CLIs\n* Build Pipelines\n\n\nThe good news is that almost all of what you're learning now is transferrable to building mobile apps in some way. This introductory coursework will put you on a good footing for learning mobile development if that's your interest.\n# Optional Starting Code\n\n```markup\n<style>\n  * {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n  }\n  i {\n    font-style: normal;\n  }\n  button {\n    outline: none;\n    border: none;\n  }\n\n  /* This phone frame is just to give the impression of a mobile site. */\n  /* Feel free to delete it and style however you want. */\n  .phone {\n    min-width: 300px;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    height: 700px;\n    border: 10px solid #333;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"phone\">\n  <div class=\"titleBar horizontalNav\">\n    <button>\n      <i>⟨</i>\n      Back\n    </button>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"content\"></div>\n  <div class=\"footerNav\">\n    <button>\n      <i>👜</i>\n      Browse\n    </button>\n    <button>\n      <i>🛒</i>\n      Cart\n    </button>\n    <button>\n      <i>🔍</i>\n      Search\n    </button>\n    <button>\n      <i>🎛</i>\n      Account\n    </button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n```\n"

It should look something like this:\n\n![A 3x3 tic tac toe board.](/assets/sfxItMSR/d476572f879076a3e659d2ac3081ef95_tic-tac-toe.png)\nIt doesn't matter which squares are blank, which have X and which have O. Just make sure that you style at least one square with an X and one with an O.\n# Why?\n\nThis challenge starts to touch on generalized UI programming rather than just text documents with the occasional image. Don't get me wrong—_most of the web_ is just text documents with the occasional image, but it's important to generalize the concepts your learning to more abstract ideas like a Tic Tac Toe board.\n\nFurthermore, we can use the tic tac toe board again later in the course to make it into a fully functional game that you can play with others or against the computer.\n\nAnd of course as always just by programming, getting more repetitions, you're building the neural pathways that will make all this stuff come as second nature to you over time.\n\n---\n\n\n> **There's almost always more than one solution**\n> \n> This challenge can be accomplished with `flex-wrap` and a fixed `width` or with a more conventional approach of three \"row\" divs and three `div`s inside them to serve as squares on the board.\n> \n> In fact there are many ways you could complete this challenge that I wouldn't even think of. That's part of the beauty of programming—there's always more than one way to get something done. It can also be a curse at times because other programmers will often do things in different ways than you would, but that's beside the point.\n"

We haven't learned enough TypeScript for that yet, so this challenge is all about HTML and CSS.\n\nYou can complete this challenge in the [Sandbox](/workspace/sandbox?type=markup). Once you're satisfied with the result export it to an HTML file. \n# Why?\n\nThere are two particularly important aspects to this project:\n\n* Get familiar with building applications, not just webpages.\n* Turn a graphic design into a real interface you can use.\n\n\n\n## Applications not web pages\n\nMany people think of HTML and CSS as tools to build web _pages_. That's certainly true, but that's not all you can do with HTML and CSS. You can also build web _applications_.\n\n> **Web applications vs web pages**\n> Possibly a silly distinction, but you will hear these terms in the wild so let's touch on this briefly. \n> \n>    * A web page is just something you read. A news site, a product page, etc.\n>    * A web application is something you interact with. It's software. Web apps also include web pages. For example, Pairwise is a web _application_ \\(you can interact with it\\) but there are many parts of app that you just read, like this page here.\n\n## From design to product\n\nTaking a graphic design and turning it into a finished product is a very important skill because:\n\n* If you work for a company or a client they might give you designs that need to turn into apps.\n* If you want to build your own product you will have to design it and then create it, even if \"designing\" it just means visualizing it in your mind before coding.\n\n# Tips and hints\n\n* You can code in whatever order works best for you, but if you're not sure then start by writing some basic HTML then give it some basic styling. Maybe create the outline of the calculator and get the size and background color right. Then move on to the inner details and repeat.\n* If you're feeling stuck try starting over from the beginning.\n   * This may seem counterintuitive but sometimes you need a blank slate to get new ideas flowing, and there's not actually that much code to write in this challenge so actually typing things out won't take too long. _Thinking about what to write_ is where you will spend most of your time.\n* If you really get stuck or you feel this challenge needs some work let us know\\! There is a feedback button in the header.\n* If you're not sure how to type a `±` symbol or a `÷` symbol just copy and paste from here.\n   * These are Unicode symbols, so it's possible to type them on your computer. It's often a pain though so when in doubt just try Googling around for the relevant symbol. \n\n"

          "content": "Also known as **deploying** your first static site.\n\n> \n> ### Jargon Time\n> \n> **Deploy**: Taking whatever code you wrote and uploading it to a server where it can be accessed. For example, no one else can see the code you wrote during this module but if you _deploy_ your code then anyone can access it with the URL. This is very important for websites.\n> **Static**: As opposed to \"dynamic.\" In this context static means that your code is just a bunch of files that can be used directly without any additional software.\n# Deployment\n\nThis is the general term for \"putting something online.\" In fact it's even more general than that. Deployment can also mean putting your mobile app on an app store. It really just means putting your code where it needs to be.\n\n## Deploying a website\n\nIn the case of a website your code needs to be on a server where anyone can access it.\n\n**NOTE:** Even if you're creating a private website with a login page and a password it's still accessible to \"anyone\" in that anyone can visit your login page, even if they can't access the content locked inside.\n\n\n## Deploying a server\n\nLater in the course we'll be deploying more than just websites and the process will be different than what you saw in the video. Deploying servers is a bit more complicated than deploying static websites because:\n\n* Deploying a website just requires moving some files to a remote computer.\n* Deploying a server requires moving some files and then _running those files_ on a remote computer.\n\n\nThe latter is what \"Cloud computing\" often refers to, but it's just a buzz word. Every \"cloud\" and every \"server\" is just someone else's computer that you rent. \n\n![This fridge sticker speaks the truth!](/assets/8YMC6xUd/5ee6958730a2bfb33dab02cf62857115_someone-elses-computer.png)\n\n## Why is hosting free sometimes?\n\nThe short answer is it's extremely cheap \\(on a marginal basis\\) to provide static hosting. It's so cheap in fact that business can make good money by providing free hosting to many, many people and charging just a small percentage of them for more advanced features. The thing is, hosting providers can treat all static sites the same way. This means they can write software to host a static site and reuse it for every customer they have. Moreover, static sites run code in web browser but not on servers. This means you can't use static sites to do nefarious things like mining bitcoin or attacking other people's websites.\n\nHowever, hosting for _servers_ is usually not free. This is because your server code is real software that has to run on a computer. However, the hosting provider does not control the software. In fact, they have no idea what software you're running. Your software could be tremendously resource intensive, requiring large amounts of computing power and electricity to run.\n\nAs a result the price of hosting servers usually ranges from extremely cheap to extremely expensive. It just depends on what your servers do and how much traffic they serve.\n\n> \n> ### Web Traffic \\(This is an aside, feel free to skip\\)\n> \n> It may not be obvious from the outside, but hosting a lot of traffic is no mean feat. Generally websites load pretty fast assuming you have a decent internet connection. For a small amount of traffic this is very easy to accomplish. If you have, say, 100 visitors every month that's no problem. The cheapest server you can rent can host that traffic with ease. You could even host that traffic from your own computer \\(although you shouldn't\\).\n> \n> Now, consider the extreme opposite: Facebook. A quick Google search told me they had 2.4 _billion_ users per month in 2018. That's roughly 1000 users _per second_ \\(nonstop, for every second of the year\\!\\). Having that many users connect to your servers every single second is decidedly **not easy, **and very expensive.\n> \n> Now consider less extreme example: Stripe, one of the most widely used payment platforms online. Stripe has many users but they deal in _transactions_. When their servers get a hit it's because someone is spending money, which happens considerably less frequently than people posting status updates and selfies to a social network. Their server costs are likely _much_ smaller than those of Facebook. \n> \n> The point is, the amount of money you might spend on a server depends entirely on the users you serve and the software you are running.\n> \n> Generally, hosting is very cheap and if you ever manage to get to 2.4 million users per month you'll have investors breaking down your door to throw money at you, so you can afford it.\n# Resources\n\n* That sweet sweet website deployed in the video: [https://meditative\\-tic\\-tac\\-toe.netlify.com/](https://meditative-tic-tac-toe.netlify.com/)\n* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n   * This is the hosting provider we used in the video. They have an online interface for managing your sites, which make them much more user friendly if you're just starting out your technical journey.\n* [Surge\\.sh](https://surge.sh/)\n   * Similar to Netlify in that they provide free hosting.\n   * You will need to use a command line interface to use Surge \\(at least last time I checked\\). This makes it much harder to use before you're familiar with a terminal.\n* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)\n   * Totally free. The others listed here have paid plans but as far as I know Github Pages doesn't even let you pay. There are probably some limits associated with that but I've never run into them.\n   * Github Pages is the hardest to get set up of all the options here, which doesn't mean it's necessarily difficult it just requires familiarity with two things we haven't covered yet \\(but we will later\\): The command line and Git.\n\n"

          "content": "The DOM \\(that's what everyone calls it\\). A big tree—in the browser.\n# What in the world is this DOM?\n\nThat explanation above not doing it for ya? Fair enough, it's a pretty bad explanation. Let's try to make things clearer. Check out this nifty code:\n\n```markup\n<body>\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"divly\">\n      One nifty div\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      This is the same code from the lesson on <code>relative</code> positioning\n      in CSS. We're going to use it to talk about <strong>THE DOM!</strong>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n\n```\n\nLooking at this code you can see that at the top we have the `body`. Within that we have a `div.container`. Within that we have our nifty `div.divly` as well as a `p` tag\\. Within the `p` tag we have some other tags... etc etc.\n\nThe code above has a hierarchical structure. \n\n> The DOM is the general term we use for the tree, or hierarchy, of elements on a web page.\n\nIt's one of those industry terms that you simply never need to know until you start working web programming. So even if this seems obscure or irrelevant just bear with me. For now you'll have to take my word that having terms to talk about \"the elements of a webpage\" is useful.\n# The DOM defines relationships\n\nOnce again, the DOM is a hierarchy or a tree. Here are some examples if you're unfamiliar with the abstract idea of a tree.\n\n## Real\\-world Trees\n\nThink of a family tree. There are parents, siblings and children. If you think of your own lineage you can think of your parents, and their parents, and their parents...  all the way back to the dawn of the human race. This hierarchical relationship \\(parents, siblings, children\\) is a tree, which is why your family tree is called that.\n\nThink of a large company. At the top their's the CEO, then there are other C\\-level executives, below them there might be department heads, then regional or project managers, then employees \\(i.e. people who don't manage other people\\). This is also a tree, although the relationships might have different names: boss, peers, direct reports.\n\nYou can of course also think of a literal tree \\(trunk, branches, leaves\\) but the DOM is a bit more abstract so the former examples might be more useful.\n\n## DOM Relationships\n\nLet's take the example from above and define some relationships. \n\n* Starting with the `body` we would say it has one child: `.container` and is the document \"root\" meaning it has no parents—no other elements above it.\n* Moving on to the `.container` div we would say its parent is `body`, it has zero siblings and two children: `.divly` and a `p` tag\\.\n* `.divly` has `.container` as its parent, has one sibling \\(`p`\\) and no children.\n   * **NOTE**: There is text within the div, but for the purposes of this explanation we're focusing solely on HTML tags.\n\n\nGiven these examples you can probably work out how we would describe the `p` tag and its children.\n"

If you have inline styles that contradict your regular CSS styles the inline styles take precedence and will be applied.\n* You cannot reuse inline styles. You can certainly copy and paste your inline styles anywhere you want, but you can't reuse styles the way you can with CSS classes. \n   * If you decide you want to change some inline styles for your whole site you will have to make the change everywhere, rather than just in one place. \n* Inline styles are usually harder to read. If you just have one or two CSS properties it's no problem, but it quickly starts becoming difficult to read inline styles as they expand.\n\n# When is this useful?\n\nGiven the downsides mentioned above, why use this at all?\n\n* You really just want some styles on one element. This happens, and inline styles are great for it.\n\n\nThat's pretty much it. However, if you're using a UI framework \\(React, for example\\) rather than plain HTML inline styles can actually be very powerful, because the framework will give you other ways to write them. We'll revisit this in UI programming.\n"

This section will take a brief look at what means for users without the usual set of senses and how we can build applications in ways that can be more accessible to those users.\n# User interfaces rely on user senses\n\nThe two big sense we care about in terms of software usability are:\n\n* Vision\n* Hearing\n\n# Software without hearing\n\nIt's likely quite easy to imagine using software without audio: You probably use software all the time without audio \n\nHowever, consider video. Imagine opening up YouTube and not being able to turn the sound on. Even if you're a master of lip reading you'd still be hard pressed to get full enjoyment out of YouTube because not all videos feature a human face speaking.\n\n## Subtitles\n\nThe obvious way to handle this is to add text for all dialogue to the video and ideally to add text descriptions for any important audio information. \n\nSubtitles are used all the time for people who can hear just fine, but in terms of accessibility subtitles try to go even further by describing significant audio events, such as a specific type of music starts playing or an abrupt sound that's meant to signal something to the viewer.\n\n## Don't make your software inaccessible\n\nWeb apps are usually pretty accessible without audio, so be aware of making them inaccessible by accident.\n\nFor example, a notification system that uses sound, rather than visuals.\n\n* Email and messaging apps use sound all the time, but it's in addition to visual indicators. Don't play a sound for a new message and forget to add a badge count or something similar. \n\n# Software without vision\n\nThis one is a bit more tricky, since most software uses vision as the key form of interaction for copying information from the computer into your head.\n\n> **A touch of empathy**\n> If you're reading this, as I suspect you are, then try shutting your eyes and reading the next paragraph after this box... it's a bit troublesome unless you're already set up for it. Now imagine if you had to use all your software that way.\n\nIf you want to impart information and vision isn't an option, what can you do? Embrace the other senses. In the physical world this is done with Braille. However, computers aren't currently well\\-suited to programmatically manipulating matter, so Braille that changed based on what's on screen would be tough to implement.\n\nHowever, computers are _very_ good at programmatically creating sound waves.\n\n## Embracing audio\n\nAudio is the path most often chosen for making visual information accessible. A whole category of software exists to read whats on screen.\n\nLet's see how we can make visual information more accessible to screen readers. Consider this image:\n\n```markup\n<img src=\"cat.jpg\" />\n\n```\n\nNot so bad right? A screen reader could parse this HTML and read the `src` aloud which would give some indication of what the photo is. Now consider this image:\n\n```markup\n<img src=\"IMG-3f4e7747-2620-44c8-94d0-bd07e2dd211d.jpg\" />\n\n```\n\nHm\\... it's not very clear from the `src` what this image is, and this type of image `src` is pretty common online. Let's update that to make it more accessible:\n\n```markup\n<img src=\"IMG-3f4e7747-2620-44c8-94d0-bd07e2dd211d.jpg\" alt=\"Cat\" />\n\n```\n\nUsing the `alt` attribute we can add text data to an image. This text data doesn't show up visually unless the user hovers the mouse over it, but it can be a big help to the visually impaired because it helps screen reader software guess what might be in the image.\n# Conclusion\n\nThis has just been a _very_ brief overview of accessibility on the web. It's a deep topic, but to start off it's enough to know that it exists and know that there may well be users of your software without access to either vision or hearing.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Screen reader software can parse HTML and read it aloud to a user.\n* \"Accessibility\" is a broad term, but on the web it almost always means \"making it easer for screen readers to read our content.\"\n\n\nCheck out this article for a more in\\-depth treatment of web accessibility: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en\\-US/docs/Web/Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)"

          "content": "We've been intentionally just glossing over things like `px` in `300px`. If you've wondered about this—good. If you're curious about something before we explain it you'll remember it better.\n# Units\n\nUnits are all about space. In the physical world you have centimeters, meters, kilometers, etc. Or maybe you use inches, feet and miles \\(5280 feet in a mile, how intuitive is that\\!\\). Either way it's a measure of physical space.\n\nCSS units measure space on screen. We've used pixels a lot because they are simple to understand. You screen has pixels so we can define space in terms of that. However, there's a lot more you can do with CSS. \n\nLet's look at the most common units.\n\n## Pixels\n\n* CSS syntax: `px`\n* Measured in screen pixels. Easy to understand but inflexible.\n* Use any numeric value.\n\n\n```css\ndiv {\n    width: 200px;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Percentages\n\n* CSS syntax: `%`\n* Measured as percentage of the parent element.\n* Use any numeric value between 0 and 100.\n\n\nPercentages are extremely useful. \n\n**Small screens**\n\nConsider that you don't know how wide you're users screen is. I don't know how wide _your_ screen is. I'm writing this on a desktop monitor but you might be reading this on an 11\\-inch laptop or you might just be using a small browser window.\n\nThe point is, you often want CSS that will look good no matter the width of the screen. Percentages are super useful for this.\n\n**Multi Columns**\n\nAnother use case is when you want some child elements to be relative to their parents.\n\n```css\n.main-content {\n    width: 65%;\n}\n.sidebar {\n    width: 35%;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Vertical Height\n\n* CSS syntax: `vh`\n* Measured as a percentage of the browser window's height\n\n\nIf you create a website you want to put your most important content at the top of the page. On the Pairwise website for instance we put a link to this workspace front and center, because we want users to see it immediately. \n\nIn web design we have a phrase for this: Above the fold. Any content that is visible without any scrolling is above the fold. You can use `vh` to style part of your site so that it is exactly the height of the \"fold\", which in this case is the browser window.\n\n> **Unnecessary Backstory**\n> As with many terms in web design, this one came from the world of print. Physical, paper newspapers are sold folded up and the most eye\\-catching headlines and content placed above that fold in order to grab the readers attention. The idea translates directly into web design though. Not everyone visiting your site will scroll at all. It's important to capture someone's interest _before_ they scroll otherwise they may just leave.\n\nThe only trick with vertical height is that it's sort of like a fixed number that's different on every browser. It doesn't care about margins or padding on the body element. You might end up with a bit of a scroll happening if you use `100vh`, which probably not what you want. \n\nI discuss this in the video and it's much easier to explain visually. \n# Font Sizes\n\nUp until now I've only been talking about widths and heights. Font\\-size is another unit of measure in CSS. Usually, you will use one of these three:\n\n* `px`: Font size in pixels. Example: `font-size: 16px;`\n* `em`: Font size relative to the parent's font\\-size. Example: `font-size: 1.2em;`\n* `rem`: Font size relative to the root element's font\\-size. Example: `font-size: 16px;`\n\n\nPixels are fairly straightforward so let's focus on the other two: `em` and `rem`. They are actually almost identical, only differing by what they are relative to.\n\n`em` is relative to the parent element. If the parent element has no font size then it's relative to the next parent up, and so on, until it gets to the root element. This means it's _exactly_ the same as `rem` if you don't use font\\-sizes except on the root element \\(the `body` tag\\).\n\n`rem` is relative to the root element—the `body` tag\\.\n\n## Usage\n\n`em` and `rem` are relative, much like `%`. Use `1em` or `1rem` to mean \"normal size text.\" `p` tags for instance are often `1em` in size, while `h1` tags could be `2em`, `3em` or any number. The point is it will likely be a higher `em` value than the `p` tag since it's meant to be larger.\n\n## Why do relative font sizes matter?\n\nYou can actually just use pixels everywhere. That's totally fine. However, you will see `em` and `rem` used a lot online because there are so many devices these days, especially mobile devices. Using `rem` and `em` lets you style text that changes its visual size to adapt to different screens nicely. \n\nOne other benefit is that you can make bits of HTML and CSS that you can copy and paste into different parts of your codebase and have them automatically size themselves. For example, you can have some styles like this:\n\n```css\n.card h3 {\n    font-size: 1.4em;\n}\n\n```\n\nIf you have a `<div class=\"card\"> ... </div>` element and you place it inside another one then it's `h3` tag will size itself according to the parent. So you can use it in different parts of your site where the font size is different, without rewriting styles.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nJust use `px` values initially. If you want to need to use `em` the need will arise naturally. The intricacies of font sizes is not the most interesting topic to spend time on.\n"

          "content": "To explain what TypeScript is we first need to introduce JavaScript.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is the language of the web. It is a programming language invented in 1995 which runs in all web browsers. Traditionally, JavaScript _only_ ran in web browsers. More recently, it can run in non\\-browsers environments like servers, using NodeJS.\n\nJavaScript is a flexible, interpreted language with dynamic typing. Any modern web application you use \\(think Google drive/documents/slides, Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, etc.\\) is built primarily in JavaScript. JavaScript is a great programming language, but it was written in a short amount of time in the early days of the internet and it does leave many things to be desired.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nTypeScript is a \"typed superset\" of JavaScript, which means it includes all of the features of JavaScript but adds some additional features on top. TypeScript is being developed by Microsoft and has existed since 2012. TypeScript is becoming widely adopted in the web development world, and is largely becoming the chosen language to write JavaScript applications. TypeScript is a \"compile to JavaScript\" language, meaning it \"compiles\" to JavaScript, which can then be run anywhere JavaScript can be run.\n\nWe have chosen to teach this introduction to software engineering course in TypeScript, rather than JavaScript. If you are interested in more of our rationale for this decision, feel free to [read it here](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum/).\n\n### Types\n\nThe primary distinguishing feature of TypeScript is the presence of \"types\" \\(hence the name\\). What this means is that any value in a TypeScript program has an associated \"type\" which the language compiler is aware of. This allows the compiler to understand, before the program can be run, whether or not some operations are \"safe\".\n\nConsider this valid JavaScript code which defines a function to say hello. You are probably expecting the function to receive a `name` variable which is a person's name like \"Sam\" or \"Sara\". But what if you give the function a number? This isn't a problem in JavaScript. It will just say \"Hello, 100\".\n\n```\nfunction sayHello(name) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + name;\n}\n\nsayHello(100);\n\n```\n\nBut in TypeScript results in the following an error:\n\n```typescript\n// We can give the function a type annotation to indicate\n// it only accepts string arguments.\nfunction sayHello(name: string): string {\n    return \"Hello, \" + name;\n}\n\n// This line results in the following error message:\n// Argument of type '100' is not assignable to parameter\n// of type 'string'.\nsayHello(100);\n\n```\n\nThe TypeScript compiler can tell you there is an error before you run the program, in fact, if you use a code editor with TypeScript support it can even tell you as you are writing the code\\!\n\nIn short, a typed language provides safeguards around defining programs which help you avoid bugs, errors, and mistakes as a program. TypeScript provides other useful features, which we will learn, but by and large the most powerful feature is the addition of type information.\n\nThe lack of types has plagued plain JavaScript programs with bugs for decades\\!\n\n### What This Means For You\n\nWe will be focusing on discussing TypeScript moving forward. However, it is helpful to remember that TypeScript includes all of the features that JavaScript does. We will discuss troubleshooting problems and searching for help online later, but for now suffice it to say if you are stuck or are interested in learning more about a topic it is perfectly valid to ask Google questions about JavaScript. The answers will be equally valid in TypeScript, and you may find more useful answers because JavaScript has existed for longer. For instance, consider these questions:\n\n* How do I define an array of items in JavaScript?\n* How do I define a function in JavaScript?\n* How do I iterate over all the keys and values in an object in JavaScript?\n\n\nThe solutions to these questions in JavaScript will apply in TypeScript as well. But remember, TypeScript includes some features JavaScript does not have, such as types. Therefore, if you are trying to find help for solving a TypeScript specific problem, you may want to include that in your search. For example:\n\n* How do I define an array type in TypeScript?\n* How do I define  a function which can accept generic type parameters in TypeScript?\n* How do I combine interface types in TypeScript?\n\n"

          "content": "Before we continue we go any further, we want to mention a few more details about TypeScript, and how TypeScript actually turns into code which can be run by a computer.\n\nTypeScript, and other \"compile to JavaScript\" languages, are compiled to JavaScript which can be run by web browsers or servers running NodeJS. This means that the source and production versions of the code can in fact be very different. The source code includes features, syntax, and additional comments in the source language which may not be present in the compiled version which is actually run by the computer.\n\n### Source vs. Production Code\n\nIn general, you can think about programs in two forms: \"source\" code which is what software engineers read and write, and \"production\" code which is what computers read and execute. Typically, source code is formatted nicely and includes things like comments to describe the code organization or context. Production code often goes through many transformation steps before it is run by a computer. \n\nTypeScript, for instance, is compiled to JavaScript. Other languages may be compiled to machine code \\(binary\\). In additional, there may be other transformation steps, such as minification, stripping of dead code or comments, obfuscation/uglification and so on.\n\n### Production JS Bundle\n\nFor instance, take a look at this snippet from the production JavaScript bundle which is rendering the Pairwise platform you are looking at right now:\n\n```\n(this.deriveChallengeContextFromId = function(e) {\n  if (!n.challengeIdIsValid(e)) return null;\n  var t = Array.from(n.courseIdSet.values()).find(function(t) {\n      return n.challengeIdInCourseIsValid(t, e);\n    }),\n    r = n.courses.find(function(e) {\n      return e.id === t;\n    }),\n    o = !0,\n    i = !1,\n    a = void 0;\n  try {\n    for (\n      var s, l = r.modules[Symbol.iterator]();\n      !(o = (s = l.next()).done);\n      o = !0\n    ) {\n      var c = s.value,\n        d = !0,\n        p = !1,\n        u = void 0;\n      try {\n        for (\n          var h, g = c.challenges[Symbol.iterator]();\n          !(d = (h = g.next()).done);\n          d = !0\n        ) {\n          var m = h.value;\n          if (m.id === e)\n            return {\n              challenge: m,\n              module: { title: c.title, id: c.id, free: c.free },\n              course: { title: r.title, id: r.id }\n            };\n        }\n      } catch (y) {\n        (p = !0), (u = y);\n      } finally {\n        try {\n          d || null == g.return || g.return();\n        } finally {\n          if (p) throw u;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  } catch (y) {\n    (i = !0), (a = y);\n  } finally {\n    try {\n      o || null == l.return || l.return();\n    } finally {\n      if (i) throw a;\n    }\n  }\n}),\n\n```\n\nThis is not very readable\\! There are a lot of obscure, single\\-letter variable names and other bad practices. In addition, in the original form this is just one long string of text \\(it's nicely formatted above so you can read it more easily\\).\n\n### Original Source Code\n\nIn contrast, here is the original piece of code:\n\n```typescript\n// Provide the course context for a challenge, given its id\nderiveChallengeContextFromId = (challengeId: string) => {\n  // Short circuit if the challenge id is invalid\n  if (!this.challengeIdIsValid(challengeId)) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // Find the associated course id\n  const courseId = Array.from(this.courseIdSet.values()).find(id =>\n    this.challengeIdInCourseIsValid(id, challengeId),\n  );\n\n  // Find the associated course\n  const course = this.courses.find(({ id }) => id === courseId);\n\n  // Construct the challenge context from the course\n  for (const module of course.modules) {\n    for (const challenge of module.challenges) {\n      if (challenge.id === challengeId) {\n        return {\n          challenge,\n          module: {\n            title: module.title,\n            id: module.id,\n            free: module.free,\n          },\n          course: {\n            title: course.title,\n            id: course.id,\n          },\n        };\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n```\n\nThis is a lot more readable and clear\\!\n\nThe important thing to note is that a lot of transformation steps exist between the code that you write and the code that the computer executes.\n\n### An Interpreted Language\n\nJavaScript is an interpreted language, which means it is not compiled and is instead executed by an interpreter which runs JavaScript and interprets it into machine instructions as it runs. A compiled language like C or Rust is compiled into machine code which a computer can directly understand and run. Don't worry too much about this distinction right now, we will cover it more in depth in a Special Topics video lesson later.\n\nFor now, just be aware that the overall flow you should be familiar with is:\n\n* Source code is written in TypeScript, which includes types, comments, and special formatting.\n* TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript, and production code undergoes many transformation steps.\n* JavaScript engines execute JavaScript by interpreting it into executable instructions.\n\n"

These words are \"reserved\", meaning you cannot use them for other purposes. For instance, you cannot name a variable \"return\" or \"function\", since these words are keywords reserved for use by the language.\n\nHere is a longer \\(but not exhaustive\\) list of keywords:\n\n* `await`: used to \"await\" a promise value in the async/await construction\n* `break`: used to \"break\" from control statement blocks\n* `case`: used to define switch statement cases\n* `catch`: used for the try/catch construction\n* `const`: used to define constants\n* `continue`: used to \"continue\" in a control statement\n* `debugger`: used to pause program execution and call the debugger function\n* `else`: used in if/else conditional statements\n* `eval`: used to arbitrarily execute a string as code\n* `false`: a boolean keyword representing \"false\"\n* `finally`: used in the try/catch/finally construction\n* `function`: used to define functions\n* `if`: used for if/else conditional statements\n* `in`: used to evaluate if a key exists in an object\n* `new`: used to instantiate a new instance of a class\n* `null`: used to represent the \"null\" empty value\n* `return`: used to \"return\" a value from a function\n* `switch`: used in a switch statement construction\n* `throw`: used to throw an error from some block of code\n* `true`: a boolean keyword representing \"true\"\n* `try`: used in the try/catch construction\n* `typeof`: used to get the type of a value\n* `var`: used to define a variable\n* `while`: used to define a while loop construction\n* `yield`: used in generator constructions\n\n\nThis does not represent all of the language keywords, but just highlights many of the most common ones. It is also worth noting that there are some keywords which are reserved for future use in the language, but which currently do not have any actual usage.\n\nDo not worry about memorizing these\\! For now just understand the concept of keywords. You will get familiar with these as you write code in the upcoming challenges."

The first code snippet has a lot of unnecessary whitespace and weird indentations.\n\n### Code Style and Formatting\n\nMany modern programming languages include specific code style conventions and formatting tools which are used to format code in a specific way. This is very powerful, because it allows code style conventions to be consistent across teams and it doesn't require the programmer to ever spend any time formatting code manually.\n\nThe Pairwise workspace \\(and the developer workflow we will teach you later in the course\\) provide and use such formatting tools. We will see them in action in the next challenge\\!\n\n### Semicolons\n\nA short note about semicolons... Semicolons are used to mark the \"end\" of many statements in TypeScript, however they are not always strictly necessary. Without getting into the weird rules regarding semicolons, we would recommend trying to end statements using `;` and otherwise relying on the automatic formatting rules if you are in doubt."

Did I _even_ write this?\"\\)\\!\n\nSoftware products have constantly changing requirements and assumptions, and you will find often yourself revisiting code you thought \"could never change\". The important thing is to write code in the first place in a way which makes it easy to change in the future, when you find that requirements or assumptions have changed.\n\nWhen you are writing code here are just a few important rules to keep in mind:\n\n* **Readability:** how easy is it to read and follow the logic in a piece of code \\(it's usually better to be straightforward than to write a clever piece of code that is harder to understand\\).\n* **Comments:** provide additional context or intention which is not clear from the code itself.\n* **Organization:** avoid complex structures, clever one\\-liners, and very nested if statements.\n* **Consistency:** use consistent style and formatting conventions.\n\n\nYou want to strive for code which is easy to read and understand by someone who is less familiar with the codebase, and easier to refactor and change in the future. This typically means code organized into many relatively small, single\\-purpose classes/functions which are easy to read and well documented/commented.\n\nStrong code design will be a theme throughout the course, so don't worry if this is not that clear yet. The main takeaway is that good software is not just about whether the code \"works\" or not. Well\\-written code not only works, but is easy to understand and refactor in the future.\n\nCongratulations\\! You've now learned many important basic concepts for writing software.

          "content": "### Embrace Errors\n\nErrors are an unavoidable part of programming software.\n\nLearning how to handle failure conditions gracefully is one of the indispensable skills of a software developer.\n\nThis section should give you a basic idea about what errors are, what they mean for a computer program, and how to handle them. The `try/catch` construct is the basic paradigm for handling unsafe operations and is common to many programming languages.\n---\n\n### Errors and Stack Traces\n\nOne more thing to mention about errors is that they often provide a specific _message_ and _stack\\-trace_. The message is meant to tell you exactly what failed, e.g. `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'address' of null`.\n\nThe stack\\-trace shows you some information about \"where the program came from\" before it failed. It's like a trail of breadcrumbs, which show you how the program ended up at the place where it crashed. For instance, here is a full error message and stack trace for a real error:\n\n```typescript\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'address' of null\n at ApplicationContainer (ApplicationContainer.tsx:123)\n    at renderWithHooks (react-dom.development.js:16260)\n    at mountIndeterminateComponent (react-dom.development.js:18794)\n    at beginWork$1 (react-dom.development.js:20162)\n    at HTMLUnknownElement.callCallback (react-dom.development.js:336)\n    at Object.invokeGuardedCallbackDev (react-dom.development.js:385)\n    at invokeGuardedCallback (react-dom.development.js:440)\n    at beginWork$$1 (react-dom.development.js:25780)\n    at performUnitOfWork (react-dom.development.js:24695)\n    at workLoopSync (react-dom.development.js:24671)\n    at performSyncWorkOnRoot (react-dom.development.js:24270)\n    at scheduleUpdateOnFiber (react-dom.development.js:23698)\n    at updateContainer (react-dom.development.js:27103)\n    at react-dom.development.js:27528\n    at unbatchedUpdates (react-dom.development.js:24433)\n    at legacyRenderSubtreeIntoContainer (react-dom.development.js:27527)\n    at Object.render (react-dom.development.js:27608)\n    at Module../src/index.tsx (index.tsx:27)\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:790)\n    at fn (bootstrap:150)\n    at Object.1 (utils.ts:523)\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:790)\n    at checkDeferredModules (bootstrap:45)\n    at Array.webpackJsonpCallback [as push] (bootstrap:32)\n    at main.chunk.js:1\n\n```\n\nThe numbers at the end of each line are line numbers in the original source code. Specifically, the list of lines are a list of function calls. The function calls of a program are piled up in a stack as a program executes, and resources allocated for handling function execution are only removed once the function _returns\\._ A stack trace is just a trace of all the function calls which led to the present place where the program failed.\n\nThe purpose of a stack\\-trace is to help the programmer track down exactly where the program got into a failure state, so it is easier to fix.\n\nStack\\-traces are scary, but they are meant to help you\\!\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIdeally, you want your programs to be error\\-free. However, you will find that is almost impossible. You will always be surprised at the strange ways computer programs can fail. What you should strive for is to write code in which it is easy and fast to understand how and why errors occurred, when they do, and to make it easy to refactor your code to fix errors when you need to. Instead of trying to write perfect code you should try to write and think about code which can be very easy to adapt to handle errors when errors occur.\n\nNow that you know about how to log information from your program with the `console`, handle, throw, and catch errors, and read stack\\-traces, you are well on your way to dealing with errors which will occur as you write your first programs\\!"

          "content": "Central to every TypeScript program is the data that it concerns, operates on, and manipulates. But what exactly is that data? How can it be described, and what are its properties?\n\nWell, TypeScript, like every programming language, has different _types_ of data. The number of types that can be created by a programming language’s users is infinite, however all languages, including TypeScript, have a set of built\\-in types, the lowest level of which are called **primitives**. These types can be operated on and manipulated by themselves, or be composed with other types to form more complex types, but this is a topic we’ll cover in more detail later. For now, let’s focus on TypeScript's most common **primitive data types**.\n\nFirst, though, let’s clear something up. \n\n## What exactly is a type?\n\nAt its most basic, a type describes a particular piece of data. A piece of data’s type lets us \\(and more importantly, the TypeScript compiler\\!\\) know how this particular piece of data can be used and what kind of operations can be performed on it. For example, something with the type `number`, should be able to be added, subtracted, divided, and multiplied with other pieces of data that also have the type `number`. Makes sense, right\\!?\n\nIn fact, you just learned your first type: `number`\\! As you might have guessed, this is one of TypeScript's primitive data types; one of the basic building blocks of the data found within a TypeScript program.\n\n> **Tip**\n> A compiler is responsible for translating code written in one programming language into another language. In many cases, compilers are responsible for translating human\\-readable source code into something called machine\\-code, which is highly optimized and only intended to be interpreted by computers. In the case of TypeScript, the compiler is responsible for translating TypeScript into JavaScript that can be executed anywhere JavaScript can be.\n\n## TypeScript Primitive Types\n\nTypeScript supports several primitive data types, including:\n\n* `number`\n* `string`\n* `boolean`\n* `null`\n* `undefined`\n\n\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, for the purpose of the next several lessons, these are the types you'll need to know. Let's take a closer look at each one in the next few challenges."

In TypeScript, _`number`_ refers to the data type, while `Number` refers to the  __global__, and more concrete, `Number` object, a concept that goes beyond the scope of this lesson. For now, it's just important that you understand the distinction, and that TypeScript is a case\\-sensitive programming language. While this may seem like a small difference, remember: in the case of `number` vs\\. `Number`, case matters\\!\n\n## Just one number\n\nIn the challenge above, we discussed that data with the type `number` in TypeScript can represent both whole and fractional values. While it is not important in the context of this course, you might find it interesting to know that commonly, in other program languages, fractional values, or _floating point_ values, are represented by another data type.

In practice this is often used in functions to make sure the variables passed in are the correct time. \n\nWe will make use of `typeof` throughout the course, so it will be become more clear in time what it can be used for. \n# A tool with a catch\n\nUsing `typeof` keyword is both very powerful and fraught with issues. The long and short of it is that it doesn't act how you expect unless you are only using it with strings, numbers and booleans.\n\nI'll show you some examples, but first, consider the following rule of thumb:\n\n> If you only trust `typeof` to work on strings, numbers and booleans it will work great for you.\n\nIf you keep that in mind you don't need to actually know the oddities below, but if you're curious read on. I'm going to say it again for emphasis: ++You don't need to memorize any of this.++ Just consider it a reference.  \n\nConsider the following. What do you expect the types to be?\n\n```typescript\ntypeof []; // => ???\ntypeof {}; // => ???\ntypeof null; // => ???\n\n```\n\nIf you're uncertain let me ask you this: Would you expect the types of `[]`, `{}`, and `null` to all the the same? Probably not, but they are:\n\n```typescript\ntypeof []; // => \"object\"\ntypeof {}; // => \"object\"\ntypeof null; // => \"object\"\n\n```\n\nThe `typeof {}` makes sense since it is indeed an object, however, `typoef null` is completely unintuitive and even worse it's not helpful.

However, as data types become more complex, or potentially ambiguous, it is sometimes useful to be more _explicit_, and tell the compiler exactly what type of data it's dealing with. In order to do this, TypeScript provides us with **type annotations**. Type annotations are a way to tell the compiler what type of data to expect, and how to treat that data. \n\nThe syntax `:` \\+ `type name` is used to annotate variables and other parts of our programs. They look like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst name: string = \"Finn\"; \n// use a colon followed by a type to explicitly type something\n\n```\n\nThis is not always necessary, since TypeScript does have very powerful type inference, which goes far beyond inferring primitive data types.

It is not a primitive type, and has no actual value that corresponds to it, the way that integer literals can be assigned to the `number` type, and string literals can be assigned to `string`. Rather, _all values_ can be assigned to `any`. \n\n```typescript\nconst quux: any = \"foo bar baz\";\nconst quuz: any = 70000;\nconst corg: any = true;\nconst flob: any = undefined;\nconst glob: any = null;\n\n```\n\n`any` is sort of like a type check escape hatch.

          "content": "In our previous lessons, we've seen a lot of code that looks something like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst foo = 100;\n\n```\n\nLet's finally take a closer look at what's going on here.  \n\n## What is a Variable?\n\nIn this example, `foo`  is what's known as a variable. Variables store _references_ to data, or _values_, which we can use in our programs. Here, `foo`  is of the type `number` and has a value of `100`.  `100` is stored in memory, but the variable `foo` holds a reference to that memory, so it can be called up again and again, and used throughout the program. This is an important concept:\n\n> Variables store references to values stored in memory, and do not store the values themselves.\n\nIn TypeScript, to give meaning to a variable, it must be _declared_, _initialized_, and _assigned_ a value. Let's break this down.\n\n## Declaration & Initialization\n\nThroughout the next several lessons, we'll primarily be using they keywords `let`  and `const` to declare our variables. Each of these keywords has a slightly different behavior, which we'll explore in more detail later.\n\nThe syntax for variable declaration requires one of these keywords and an identifier, or name, to act as the variable's unique identifier.  When we declare a variable, it is automatically _initialized_, and memory is allocated for it. Once initialized, a variable will be `undefined` until we assign a value to it. \n\n```typescript\nlet baz; // baz is undefined\n\n```\n\n## Assignment\n\nThat's where the `=` operator comes in. Assignment is pretty intuitive: to the left of the `=` is the variable that we're assigning a value to \\(the left operand\\), and to the right of it is the value that we're assigning \\(the right operand\\).  In other words, the assignment operator gives the value of its right operand to its left operand. That's it\\!\n\nA variable can be declared and initialized first, and assigned a value later in the program. \n\n```typescript\nlet baz; // baz has been declared and intialized, and is undefined\n// do something...\nbaz = \"a string\"; // baz has been assigned a value\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, a variable can be declared, initialized, and given a value in a single statement.\n\n```typescript\nconst bar = \"cool!\"; // bar has been declared, initialized, and assigned a value\n\n```\n\nA quick note here: the process of assigning a variable a value for the first time \\(as in the above example\\) is also sometimes referred to as \"initialization\", since we're \"initializing\" the variable with a value. However, from a theoretical standpoint, true \"initialization\" happens when the variable is declared and the JavaScript engine \\(which ultimately runs all of our TypeScript code, since TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript before execution\\) allocates memory for it.\n\nWe're going to dive deeper into variables and assignment in the next few lessons.\n\nLet's go\\!"

In other words, if you assign the string `\"immutable\"` to a variable declared with `const`, you can always count on that variable being equal to the string `\"immutable\"`. Likewise, if you assign it a number, a boolean, null, or undefined. These types are immutable by nature, and values of these types cannot change over time \\(if a string or number appears to change over time, it is really a new instance of a string or number\\).\n\nFor more complex data types, though, `const` can trip you up if you're not careful. Check out the following examples using arrays:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // error! arr cannot be reassigned\n\n```\n\nLike you would expect, you cannot assign `arr` a new array \\(or any other value\\). However:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr.push(4);\n// here, .push(4) adds the number 4 to the end of the list\n// the list now equals [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n```\n\nAlthough we didn't assign `arr` a new value, its current value is different than the value we originally assigned to it. More precisely, the array that `arr` references has been _mutated_.\n\nWe will explore the concept of immutability more in future lessons, but for now, you should be aware that `const` only ensures that a variable cannot be reassigned, _not_ that the value it references is immutable."

The prefix operator increments its operand and returns its value _after being incremented_, while the postfix operator increments its operand and returns its value _before being incremented_. Let's take a look again with some results:\n\n```typescript\nlet a = 3;\nlet b = 3;\nlet c = ++a; // c = 4 prefix returned a after being incremented\nlet d = b++; // d = 3 postfix returned b before being incremented\n// a = 4, b = 4 both a and b were incremented\n\n```\n\n\n## The Decrement Operator\n\nSimilar to the increment operator, is the decrement, or `--` operator\\. It's a unary operator that behaves much the same way as the `++` operator, except that it decrements its numeric operand, rather than increments it. \n\n```\nlet x = 100;\nx--; // x = 99\n\n```\n\nLike the increment operator, `--` can only be used on variables declared with `let`. It also has identical prefix and postfix behaviors \\(if used prefix, it returns the value of its operand after being decremented, and vice versa if used postfix\\).\n\n```\nlet x = 100;\nlet q = 100;\nlet y = --x; // y = 99, x = 99\nlet z = q--; // z = 100, q = 99\n\n```\n\nWe're not going to cover this operator in a separate lesson, because its behavior is so similar to what we've covered here.

Its only purpose is to convert its operand to a number \\(if it isn't one already\\) and return the result. Note that the operand itself _is not_ affected\\.\n\n```\nconst fiveAsString = \"5\";\nconst fiveAsNumber = +fiveAsString;\n// fiveAsString = \"5\", fiveAsNumber = 5\n\n```\n\nTry this out in the [sandbox](/workspace/sandbox) on more complex string representations of numbers \\(e.g. `\"-23543.0274\"`\\), and on values other than strings and see what you get\\! For instance, what do you expect the result to be when you use the unary plus operator on booleans or on `null`?\n\n```\nconst isTrue = true;\n+isTrue // ??\n\n```\n\nExperimentation and fun aside, It should be noted here, however, that there are other, more preferred ways to convert values to numbers in TypeScript. The unary plus operator is borderline esoteric, but will work just fine for simple use\\-cases. For more complex cases, other methods are preferred:\n\n```\nconst notReallyPi = \"3.14IsPie...err...ImeanPi\";\nconst definitelyNotPi = +notReallyPi; // NaN (not a number)\nconst pi = parseFloat(notReallyPi); // 3.14\n\n```\n\nThis example is obviously contrived, but you get the picture.\n\n## The Unary Negation Operator\n\nThe unary negation, or `-`, operator negates the value of its operand. If its operand is not a number, it also converts it to a number before negating it.\n\n```\nconst threeAsNumber = 3;\nconst threeAsString = \"3\";\n-threeAsString; // -3\n-threeAsNumber; // -3\n\n```\n"

          "content": "### Control Statements\n\nThere are two major types of control statements in programming: conditional statements and loops. We will cover conditional statements first, and then loops. Control statements are just statements that determine if other blocks of code will be execute or not. They are one of the fundamental building blocks for building software with more complex behavior.\n\n### Conditional Statements\n\nYou are definitely familiar with conditional statements from everyday life: they are basically statements which take the form:\n\n> _If_ it is raining, _then_ I should wear a coat and take an umbrella.\n\nConditional statements are just a way of making decisions based on conditions which can be true or false.\n\n### The if/else Construction\n\nConditional statements in TypeScript \\(and many other languages\\) are constructed using the keywords `if`, `else`, and `else if`. For instance:\n\n```\nif (isRaining) {\n    // Handle rainy weather\n} else if (isSunny) {\n    // Handle sunny weather\n} else {\n    // Handle other weather conditions\n}\n\n```\n\nTo construct a conditional statement you must start with the `if` keyword and then add a _condition_ in parentheses. The _condition_ will determine whether the statement in the `{ ... }` should run or not. If not, the program will proceed to evaluate the next condition, if one exists.\n\nIf/else statements can only result in the execution of a single statement. For example, in the above example, if `isRaining` is `false` but `isSunny` is `true`, then the code in the `isSunny` block will run and then the computer will continue outside of the if/else construction. It will never visit the `else` block, because it has already found a matching condition.\n\nIf/else statements are a very simple way to program decision making into software and probably the most common. If/else statements are not the only way to write conditional statements, however. Other options include switch statements and ternary expressions.\n\n### Ternary Expressions\n\nA ternary expression is a shorthand way for writing an if/else statement. Consider a value which can have two states, like `isLoggedIn` which can be `true|false`. The following code is equivalent:\n\n```\n// Using an if/else statement\nfunction getUserAccount(isLoggedIn: boolean) {\n    if (isLoggedIn) {\n        return UserAccount;\n    else {\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\n// Using a ternary expression\nfunction getUserAccount(isLoggedIn: boolean) {\n    return isLoggedIn ? UserAccount : null;\n}\n\n```\n\nA ternary expression collapses an if/else statement into the `condition ? ... : ...` shorthand\\. This syntax may look a little strange, but it is just saying: _if_ the condition is true `?` then do this, _else_ `:` do that. The ternary is a common structure in many languages, and can be a useful way for writing if/else logic in a short and concise manner. \n\nHowever, a word of caution: be careful not to abuse using ternary expressions\\! It is easy to write complex if/else logic using ternaries which later becomes very hard to read or understand.\n\n### Switch Statements\n\nSwitch statements also allow you to write if/else logic, however, they are specifically useful for handling multiple states for a single value. For example, consider the weather example above and imagine we are building an app which shows a different display based on the current weather conditions. Our weather type is defined like this:\n\n```typescript\ntype WEATHER = \"SUNNY\" | \"RAINY\" | \"SNOWY\" | \"CLOUDY\";\n\n```\n\nWe can then write a switch statement to \"switch\" over the different options the weather can be in order to handle each \"case\" separately. Here is the code:\n\n```\nfunction handleWeatherConditions(weather: WEATHER) {\n    switch (weather) {\n        case \"SUNNY\":\n            // Handle sunny weather\n            break;\n        case \"RAINY\":\n            // Handle rainy weather\n            break;\n        case \"SNOWY\":\n            // Handle snowy weather\n            break;\n        case \"CLOUDY\":\n            // Handle cloudy weather\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Handle fall through case\n            break;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can see this is a very structured way for handling different variations of a value. A few things to note about switch statements:\n\n* Switch statements are defined using the `switch` keyword, which then must specify the value to \"switch\" over in parentheses.\n* Each \"case\" in a switch statement is defined using the `case` statement and then the value it which should match that case.\n* You must `break` or `return`from a case once you handle a condition, unless you want the switch statement to continue checking other cases. This behavior differs from normal if/else statements.\n* You can use a `default` block to handle fall through values. This is like the finally `else` statement in an if/else construction.\n\n\n### Conditionals in Action\n\nThink about some software you commonly use and imagine the many decisions the software must make as you are using it. All of these decisions are encoded using if/else statements, switch statements, and ternary expressions. These are the basic building blocks for building complex software which can handle many different states and behaviors.\n\nThere are no pre\\-defined ways for you to mix and combine these conditional statements. You can nest them together, or combine them, in any way you want. You can have an if/else statement with a switch statement inside the `if` block, and some ternary expressions in there. The code might not be very readable, but there is nothing to prevent you from doing that\\!\n\nNow, let's get some practice working with conditional statements\\!"

These videos would find their way into a shared network drive, where I could then access them using my super admin powers. \n> \n> This was very easy. I would open the upload folder for a professor and rename each file to include the current date, the uploader's user id, and the original name of the file. However, as I mentioned earlier, _this was _**super** tedious\\. So, like any future programmer I thought to myself \"There must be a better way\\! 😫\" and then proceeded to do nothing about it for a whole week.\n> \n> After a week though, I had had enough and I set out on a Google\\-searching mission that eventually lead me to loops\\! Well, loops and a bunch of cobbled together code that semi\\-sort\\-of automated some of my tedious task using shell scripts \\(a topic we'll cover another time\\). The point is my job became much more enjoyable because I learned about looping. \n> \n> I was doing _less_ work and getting _more_ done\\.\n# Looping\n\nLooping is conceptually simple—it's telling a computer to do the same thing repeatedly until some condition is met.

If we wanted 10 to be included we could use the `<=` operator instead.\n\nWhat you just saw is called a `for` loop\\. \n\n## For Loops\n\nWhen you want to run some code N number of times. For example, in the code above we wanted to `console.log` 10 times so we wrote a loop to do exactly that.\n\nThis is what a `for` loop is for—running some code over and over again until some condition is met.\n\n### Syntax\n\nLet's take a look at that code again: \n\n```typescript\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n\n```\n\nNow let's look at some fake code to explain the various parts of a for loop:\n\n```\nfor (SETUP; CONDITION; AFTER_EACH) { CODE_TO_RUN }\n\n```\n\nLet's look at each piece in turn:\n\n* `SETUP`: Here you can define variables you need for your loop. In our example we have `let i = 0`.\n* `CONDITION`: The loop will keep running as long as this condition is true. In the example it's `i < 10`, so the loop will run as long as `i` is less than 10.\n* `AFTER_EACH`: Code to run after each loop. In our example it's `i++`, so after each loop the variable `i` will be incremented. This is very important. Without `i++` in the example the code would run forever because `i` would _always_ be less than 10.\n* `CODE_TO_RUN`: This is where you write whatever code you want to run in the loop. In the example it's `console.log(i)`.\n\n\nNow that we've seen the syntax let's take a look at another type of loop.\n\n## While Loops\n\nHere's a `while` loop that does the exact same thing as our `for` loop example from above:\n\n```typescript\nlet i = 0; // SETUP\nwhile (i < 10) { // CONDITIOKN\n  console.log(i); // CODE_TO_RUN\n  i++; // AFTER_EACH\n}\n\n```\n\nI've gone ahead and labeled the various parts using comments. This does exactly the same thing as our `for` loop from before, but the syntax is slightly different.\n\n### Syntax\n\nLet's again look at some fake code.\n\n```\nSETUP\nwhile (CONDITION) {\n  CODE_TO_RUN\n  AFTER_EACH\n}\n\n```\n\nAll the parts are the same as with the `for` loop, but they've been rearranged a bit. \n\n### Uses\n\nWhy do we need both types of loops? They're good for different things.\n\n* `while` loops are more flexible, but harder to use.\n* `for` loops are less flexible, but easier to use.\n\n\nUsually when you know how many times you want to iterate you should use a for loop. We could log all the elements of an array like so:\n\n```typescript\nconst arr = [3, 5, 1, 6, 7];\nfor (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n  console.log(arr[i]);\n}\n\n```\n\nHere we know exactly how many times to iterate because we know the length of the array. We want to iterate 5 times \\(`arr.length`\\).\n\nNow with a `while` loop:\n\n```typescript\nconst arr = [3, 5, 1, 6, 7];\nlet i = 0;\nwhile (i < arr.length) {\n  console.log(arr[i]);\n  i++;\n}\n\n```\n\nIt takes a bit more code to write the `while` loop\\. It's also _super_ easy to forget to write `i++` at the end of the loop, causing an infinite loop\\!\n\n`while` loops are really useful when you don't know how many times you want to iterate. When does this happen? There are many data structures that you cannot access using an index like you can with an array. That's for later in the course. For now let's just pretend you cannot use indices to access elements of arrays. The only thing you can do is `pop`.\n\n```typescript\nconst arr = [3, 5, 1, 6, 7];\nlet next = arr.pop(); // Start off with the last element of the array\n\nwhile (next) {\n  console.log(\"Next:\", next);\n  next = arr.pop();\n}\n\n```\n\nThat code will log out:\n\n```none\nNext: 7\nNext: 6\nNext: 1\nNext: 5\nNext: 3\n\n```\n\nNotice that we didn't use indices at all\\! We just used `pop` and kept on popping from the array until there was nothing left.\n\nYou might be thinking this is silly, because we can clearly see there are only 5 elements in the array. True. However, in practice arrays often have more elements in them—hundreds or thousands.\n\nMore importantly, there are data structures that really don't give you indexes you can use to access the values. In those cases you might need the power of a `while` loop\\.\n\nJust be careful...\n\n## Infinite Loops\n\nThis is not a type of loop, it's just .a good way to freeze your computer.\n\n```typescript\nwhile (true) {\n  console.log(\"And... computer is frozen\");\n}\n\n```\n\nThis code will freeze your computer, or at least your browser tab. It's a loop that _never stops_\\! Take a moment to think about that. \n\nThe code above is saying while `true` is true, keep on looping. `true` will always be true, so there's no reason for the loop to stop. So it will keep running until you force quit .your browser or restart your computer.\n\nIt's actually fairly easy to write infinite loops by accident. You _will_ write some as you learn to program, and your browser might freeze. That's just part of learning though."

This runs the function and returns the result, which you can assign to a variable. Invoking one of the math functions from the previous challenge looks like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst FIFTY = multiply(5, 10);\n\n```\n\nThe `()` _invoke_ the function.

Consider the following:\n\n```typescript\n// Add up all the numbers in an array\nfunction sumArray(list: number[], sum: number = 0, index: number = 0): number {\n    // Base Case:\n    if (index === list.length) {\n        return sum;\n    }\n    \n    // Recursive Case:\n    return sumArray(list, sum + list[index], index + 1);\n}\n\n```\n\nThis function `sumArray`, takes a list of values and two other arguments. The other arguments have _default values_ which means that if they are left `undefined` they will be defaulted to the value provided by `=`. So you can call `sumArray` directly with a list of values, like this: `sumArray([1,2,3])`. The function then has a \"base case\" and a \"recursive case\".\n# The Base Case\n\nThe \"base case\" is what ends the recursive call. Recursion is the practice of breaking a problem into smaller sub\\-problems, but eventually you must reach some \"base\" problem where the solution is known. This is the base case and it ends the recursion.\n# The Recursive Case\n\nThe \"recursive case\" is the logic of actual performing the recursion. In our above example of adding the contents in an array the recursive logic is to add the current sum to the current value at the given `index`. Then, we call the `sumArray` method _again_ with that sum and the next index.\n\n`sumArray` _calls itself_ for every index in the array, starting at `0`, until it reaches the index after the end of the array. Each call builds up a `sum` value which tracks the sum of elements visited in the array. The base case just returns this `sum`. The recursive cases _return_ the call to `sumArray`.\n# Unwinding the Stack\n\nJavaScript engines use a call stack to manage function execution. JavaScript engines, or \"interpreters\", execute JavaScript code by interrupting it and translating it into instructions your computer can directly execute. For every time a function is called, the JavaScript engine allocates memory and resources to handle the execution of that function in the form of a new frame it pushes onto the call stack. The call stack is just a \"stack\" of these such execution contexts.\n\nOnce an interpreter completes the execution of a function \\(reaches the `return` statement\\), the function is finished, the interpreter removes that function's execution context from the call stack and then returns to the execution of the previous function which should still be ongoing. In this way, the call stack \"unwinds\" as function executions are completed.\n\nImagine the execution of `sumArray` above\\. You can consider it like this:\n\n```\n// The initial call\nsumArray([1,2,3]);\n\n// 2nd call (recursive)\nsumArray[1,2,3], 1, 1);\n\n// 3nd call (recursive)\nsumArray[1,2,3], 3, 2);\n\n// 4th call (base case reached)\nsumArray[1,2,3], 6, 3);\n\n```\n\nBy the time the 4th call is reached, the call stack still contains the context for the previous 3 function calls. This is because each function call results in calling the same function again. It's not until the base case is reached that these function calls \"unwind\" backwards, which eventually leads to the final sum of `6` being returned at the original call site.\n\nDon't worry if this doesn't all make sense \\(we will cover this topic of program execution in more depth elsewhere\\). For now, there are two important takeaways:\n\n1\\) Interpreters allocate resources for function execution on a call stack.\n2\\) Function invocations push new frames onto the call stack.\n# Stack Overflows\n\nThe second point above is important to understand because computers have memory limits for operation. Usually programs do not reach memory limits, but it can and does happen \\(it will happen to you\\!\\). It is actually somewhat easy to encounter when writing recursive functions, because interpreters typically allocate a decent amount of memory for function invocations and impose limits on how many times a function can call itself. This is usually enough for recursive solutions to complete execution, but it is easy to write an infinitely recursive function, like this:\n\n```typescript\nfunction callMyselfInfinitely() {\n    return callMyselfInfinitely();\n}\n\n```\n\nIf you tried to run this code you will quickly get this result:\n\n```\nUncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:1:30)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n    at callMyselfInfinitely (<anonymous>:2:12)\n\n```\n\nThis is a \"stack overflow\" \\(and the origin of the name of the popular programming question and answer site [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)\\). It's important to remember the recursive functions are prone to this error, especially if you do not handle the base case effectively. It could also occur if you simply had a really large input size.\n# All Recursions Can Be Iterative\n\nOur `sumArray` function could easily be written in an iterative way, and in fact, as a rule any recursive solution can be implemented using iteration.\n\n```\n// Sum a list of numbers using iteration\nfunction sumArrayIterative(list: number[]): number[] {\n    let sum = 0;\n    // Iterate through the list and build up the sum\n    for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {\n        sum += list[i];\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n\n```\n\n> Any recursion solution can be implemented using iteration.\n\nThis point is helpful to keep in mind once you add recursion into your toolbox of problem\\-solving tools. But, it also raises the question: Why use recursion to solve a problem? Recursion is often a more mind\\-bending way to solve problems.\n# Why Recursion?\n\nIt turns out some problems are much more suited to being solved with recursion. Many data structures, like trees, are naturally recursive data structures. As a result, many tree algorithms are very simple as recursive algorithms and likewise very complex as iterative algorithms. Consider the [infamous tree inversion algorithm](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15713801):\n\n```typescript\n// A tree node\ninterface Node {\n    left: Node;\n    right: Node;\n    value: any;\n}\n\n// Given a binary tree, invert it\nfunction invertTree(node: Node) {\n    // Handle the base case of reaching a leaf node\n    if (node === null) {\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // Get the left and right sub trees\n    const leftTree = node.left;\n    const rightTree = node.right;\n    \n    // Switch them\n    node.left = rightTree;\n    node.right = leftTree;\n    \n    // Invert the left and right sub trees\n    invertTree(node.left);\n    invertTree(node.right);\n}\n\n```\n\nThe solution is a little more verbose for clarity, but you can write it in a more concise way in just a few lines of code. This is because the tree is a recursive structure. Therefore, the solution to \"inverting\" the tree is just to invert the given node, and then invert the node's left and right children by calling the inversion function again. Add the base case where you reach a left node and you're done\\! The solution is simple, short, and elegant. Try writing the same thing using iteration\\!\n\n> **Side note:** A tree structure is a data structure composed of nodes where a node has a \"parent\" and \"children\". A binary tree is one such structure where each parent has two children. Trees look just like real world trees: there is on root node which branches out with many children until the \"leaf\" nodes are reached. Leaf nodes are typically represented with a `null` value\\. Tree data structures are used in many places \\(not the least of which are software engineering interview questions\\).\n> \n> In fact, you are staring at a tree structure right now in your web browser: The DOM \\(document object model\\). The DOM is how web browsers represent HTML documents as webpages. These documents are represented as trees, where child HTML elements are all nested within their parents, and there is one common parent tag, the `body` tag\\.\n\nRecursion is a powerful concept to understand, and a very useful tool to have at your disposal. It is a little mind\\-bending, but once you wrap your head around it you'll gain a new useful tool. This section will cover some simple challenges which can be solved using recursion."

This helps to improve the organization and readability of your program, and it may prevent bugs and problems as well.\n\nHowever, scope is not the only tool a programmer has to accomplish a goal like this.\n\nLater on, you will learn how to write programs and build apps using a real code environment \\(not this fun editor playground in a browser\\!\\). When you reach that stage, you will have a lot of other tools at your disposal.\n\nFor example, you can define parts of your program in different files, put related files in different folders, and then _import_ values from one file into another. You can also control what you _import_ and _export_. This is a very powerful capability for organizing software programs. These same skills will also allow you to download open source code other people have written and import this code in your own projects as well\\! This is incredibly useful and opens the doors to building a number of interesting applications\\!\n\nYou will learn the details of this later, but for now just keep it in mind as a short preview and extension of the ideas of scopes which will come in handy later\\!\n\nTake a look at this code snippet for a short teaser:\n\n```typescript\n// This imports the library \"request\", which is open source and written\n// and maintained by other developers.\nimport request from \"request\";\n\n// The request library lets you make HTTP requests to URLs!\nrequest(\"http://www.google.com\", (error, response, body) => {\n  if (error) {\n    throw error;\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"Success!, Response received: \", body);\n    // Do somethine else here...\n  }\n});\n\n```\n"

          "content": "# What is a Closure?\n\nA closure refers to the bundling of a function with its enclosing state. Closures are tricky concepts to understand, let's start with a simple example:\n\n```typescript\nconst name = \"Sam\";\n\nfunction closureDemonstration() {\n    // The name constant is defined in the outer scope\n    return name;\n}\n\n```\n\nThe `closureDemonstration` function returns the `name` variable which is defined in the outer scope. When `closureDemonstration` executes, it can \"capture\" references to values in the outer scope which are then available within the body of the function. This is what is referred to as a closure.\n\n> The `closureDemonstration` function has a \"closure\" on the `name` value\\.\n\nIn TypeScript, closures are created every time a function is created and prepared for execution. A closure refers simply to this characteristic of functions that they can capture references to values in their surrounding environment or scope.\n# Why Are Closures Useful?\n\nYou may be thinking \"That's interesting... but what's the point?\"\n\nClosures are useful for many reasons:\n\n* The module pattern depends on the existence of closures.\n* Closures provide way for sharing state and updating between functions.\n* Closures allow for function composition with unique properties.\n\n\nAlso, closures are useful for these meta\\-reasons:\n\n* Closures often come up in engineering interview questions.\n* Understanding closures can help to understand the general execution of functions and programs.\n\n# A Practical Example\n\nLet's see a practical application of closures:\n\n```typescript\n// Create a counter tool\nconst createCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {\n  let value = initialValue;\n\n  // The returned value as a private \"closure\" on the\n  // value variable\n  return {\n    increment: () => {\n      value = value + 1;\n    },\n    decrement: () => {\n      value = value - 1;\n    },\n    getValue: () => {\n      return value;\n    },\n  };\n};\n\nconst counter = createCounter(15);\n\ncounter.increment();\ncounter.increment();\ncounter.increment();\ncounter.getValue(); // -> 18\n\ncounter.value; // Property 'value' does not exist\n\n```\n\nHere we create and return a `counter` object which has a value and can be incremented or decremented. The counter tracks its state internally using a closure on the `value` variable _which cannot be accessed from the outside._\n\nThis, in essence, illustrates the idea of the module pattern. This design pattern allows us to hide state \\(and anything else we need, like other methods\\) from code outside. If you are building something with an external API, this allows you to separate the API from the implementation and keep the implementation private.\n\nClosures have many other practical applications as well, but the most important thing at this stage is to understand what they are and there basic application. This section will walk through some simple challenges which involve closures."

The point is if we want to represent any of these things digitally we need the concept of a list in our programs. In TypeScript this takes the form of the `Array`.\n\n## Why objects are important\n\nThe idea of an object is a \"thing\" that has properties. For example, you—being a person—probably have a name, a job, and a _list_ of favorite HTML colors:\n\n```typescript\nconst me = {\n  name: \"Ian\",\n  job: \"Building Pairwise\",\n  favoriteHTMLColors: [\"Salmon\", \"Tomato\", \"Lime\"],\n};\n\n```\n\nYou see what I did there? An object con contain a list and likewise a list can also contain an object. TypeScript is very flexible like this.\n\n```typescript\nconst people = [\n  {\n    name: \"Ian\",\n    job: \"Building Pairwise\",\n    favoriteHTMLColors: [\"Salmon\", \"Tomato\", \"Lime\"]\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Sean\",\n    job: \"Building Pairwise\",\n    favoriteHTMLColors: [\"SeaShell\", \"Coral\", \"MediumSeaGreen\"]\n  }\n];\n\n```\n\\(Sean doesn't yet know he favors the \"beach theme\" of HTML colors 🤫\\)\n\nAnother way to visualize the data above in the `people` array is as a table. Consider this more familiar form: \n| **Name** | **Job** | **Favorite HTML Colors** |\n|:--- |:--- |:--- |\n| Ian | Building Pairwise | Salmon, Tomato, Lime |\n| Sean | Building Pairwise | SeaShell, Coral, MediumSeaGreen |\n\nLook at that\\! By adding arrays and objects to our arsenal we can suddenly represent tabular data, which means we can represent anything you can put into a spreadsheet \\(quite literally, just look at Google Sheets\\).\n\nWe can even build on top of objects and arrays to create new data structures. \n# Syntax\n\nOK, now that we  know _why_ let's talk about _how_. The syntax for arrays and objects is fairly simple, but it may not be intuitive.\n\n## Creating Arrays and Objects\n\n```typescript\nconst htmlColors = [\"Salmon\", \"Tomato\", \"Lime\"];\nconst cat = {\n  name: \"Maomi\",\n  job: \"Napping\",\n  favoriteHTMLColors: [\"LightSalmon\", \"Salmon\", \"DarkSalmon\"] // Yes, these are real colors\n};\n\n```\n\nWe've created a new array with three wonderful HTML color names inside it and we've created a new `cat` object with some cat\\-appropriate properties.\n\n> **Syntax Specifics**\n> To create an array place any valid values separated by `,`within `[` and `]`\n> To create an object\n> \n> \n>    * Open `{` and `}` brackets\n>    * With the brackets use a string, followed by `:` , followed by any valid value to create a key\\-value pair\n\n## Using Arrays and Objects\n\n```typescript\nconsole.log(htmlColors[1]); // => \"Tomato\"\nconsole.log(cat.job); // \"Napping\"\nconsole.log(cat.favoriteHTMLColors[0]); // \"LightSalmon\"\n\n```\n\nHere we log three things out to the console.\n\n1. Log the string at index `1` of the `htmlColors` array\\.\n1. Log the value associated with the key `job` on the `cat` object\\.\n1. Log the string at index `0` of the array at key `favoriteHTMLColors` on the `cat` object\\.\n\n\nThe third line is an example of using nested selectors. \n\n> **Syntax Specifics**\n> To access an element within an array use a number placed between `[` and `]` after the array\n> To access a value associated with a key on an object place the key after a the object and a `.`\n> Alternatively, objects can use the same syntax as arrays except rather than a number use a string: `console.log(cat[\"name\"]);`\n"

For example if there are 8 elements in your array \\(i.e. the `length` is eight\\) and you want the last element you might be tempted to write `someArray[8]`. However, this will give you `undefined` for your troubles because the last element is actually at index `7`.\n# When in doubt, log it out\n\nOver time you will get used to this fact and you will not need to think much to work with arrays by index. However, it can get pretty confusing trying to think about what's at which index using simply your brain—after all, that's what computers are for. If you're ever in doubt just drop a `console.log` into your code somewhere and see what value you're actually getting.\n# Useful beyond TypeScript\n\nZero\\-based indexes is a fairly foundational concept in programming so it's worth trying to remember this early on. Mainstream programming languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, Swift, C\\# and of course JavaScript all use zero\\-based indexes. In fact, if you work as a software engineer or you write software for any reason at all the chances are overwhelmingly that you'll be using a language with zero\\-based indexes.\n\nAs with much of what you're learning in this course this knowledge is foundational."

          "content": "Replacing text is all about transforming one string into another string. Some really common uses for text replacement are:\n\n* Remove unwanted characters from a string. In other words, replacing unwanted characters with an empty string.\n* \"Escape\" characters in a string to make it viable as a URL \\(Ever wonder why URLs don't have spaces in them?\\)\n* Turn plain text URLs into `a` tags so they can be clicked. For example: `http://example.com` can be replaced with `<a href=\"http://example.com>http://example.com</a>` and it will become clickable in a browser.\n\n# Replacing text is unintuitive\n\nUnfortunately, text replacement might not work as you expect. Consider this example:\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(\" \", \"_\"); // => ???\n\n```\n\nWhat would you expect this to return? Intuitively you might expect all spaces to be replaced by underscores \\(\"\\_\"\\) but that's not the case. Only the fist space will get replaced:\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(\" \", \"_\"); // => \"hello_fellow learners\"\n\n```\n\nHm\\... 🤔 This might be what you want but usually it's more useful to replace _every_ occurrence of a string. In this case what we want is `\"hello_fellow_learners\"`. In order to get that we need to use regular expressions—regex for short. Let's look at how we would make the previous example replace _all spaces_ with underscore.\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(/ /g, \"_\"); // => \"hello_fellow_learners\"\n\n```\n# Using Regex for String Replacement\n\nThe `replace` function can work with just a string as the first argument, but if you want to do more advanced replacements or even simply replace all occurrences of a string you will need to use regex.\n\n\n## Replacing All Occurrences\n\nThe key to replacing all matched strings is to use a global regex, namely the `g` flag\\.\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(/ /g, \"_\"); // => \"hello_fellow_learners\"\n\n```\n\nLet's look at that example from above again. Take note of the `g` directly after the regex matching the space character \\(`/ /`\\). That `g` flat informs the `replace` function that we want to replace _globally_ rather than just the first occurrence.\n\nIf we were to leave out the `g` flat we would get the same result as when we used a string.\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(/ /, \"_\"); // => \"hello_fellow learners\"\n\n```\n# Getting the Right Regex\n\nConsidering how obscure regex syntax can be, we recommend using a tool to build up regex unless you're already familiar with the replacement you want to do. In the starter code for this challenge we used the regex `/\\./g` to replace all periods in a string. You can find an interactive example of that regex [here](https://regex101.com/r/9y1K7w/1).\n\n## Use Regex 101\n\nIn general, we recommend that whenever you're unsure of a regex you use an online tool for visualizing the results of your regex. At present we recommend Regex 101.\n\n* [Regex101\\.com](https://regex101.com/r/9y1K7w/1)\n\n"

          "content": "Finding the index of something in an array is often very important, more important than you might think. Consider this list of todos:\n\n```\nconst todos = [\n  { title: \"Buy soymilk\", completed: true },\n  { title: \"Write finding indices challenge\", completed: false },\n  { title: \"Bake cookies\", completed: true },\n];\n\n```\n\nThis list could serve as the data behind a simple todo app. Now imagine you have such an app and you click a checkbox to complete the middle item `\"Write finding indices challenge\"`. Before you click the app might look like this:\n\n![](/assets/yOKFRV46u/14d3762625a2d63ead4bb83896bf3cea_todo.png)\nOnce you click the todo item to complete it you will want to update the array to reflect that. If we know the index it's quite simple, if relatively verbose:\n\n```\nlet todos = [\n  { title: \"Buy soymilk\", completed: true },\n  { title: \"Write finding indices challenge\", completed: false },\n  { title: \"Bake cookies\", completed: true },\n];\n\n// Before\nconsole.log(todos[index].completed); // false\n\nconst index = /* ??? */;\n\ntodos = [\n  ...todos.slice(0, index),\n  {\n    ...todos[index],\n    completed: true,\n  },\n  ...todos.slice(index + 1),\n];\n\n// After\nconsole.log(todos[index].completed); // true\n\n```\n\nIn this case the index would be `1`, which you can tell just by looking at the tiny array, but what if we have 200 todos or 2000? It becomes necessary to find the index without having to look at it with our human eyes. We need the computer to find it for us.\n# indexOf\n\nTaking a step back from the todos example, let's consider a simple list of numbers:\n\n```typescript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 256];\n\n```\n\nWhat's the index of `256`? Again you can tell just by looking at the array for a second but we want the computer to tell us. To do this we can use the `indexOf` function\\.\n\n```typescript\nnumbers.indexOf(256); // => 6\n\n```\n\nGreat\\! But we can pass anything into `indexOf`, what if we ask for something that doesn't exist in the array?\n\n```typescript\nnumbers.indexOf(8); // => -1\n\n```\n\n`-1` what's going on there 🤔?\n\n## Why indexOf can return \\-1\n\nThe reason for this oddity is that `-1` is an invalid index. So by returning an invalid index `indexOf` is telling us that there is no `8` in the array.\n# findIndex\n\n`indexOf` is great for finding a specific thing when you know exactly what that thing is. Finding `256` was easy because we knew exactly what we were looking for and we could tell the computer. However, sometimes you need to find items based on criteria rather than a specific value. There is a function just for this called `findIndex`.\n\nThis brings us back to the todo list example. We can fill in the question marks from earlier with `findIndex`:\n\n```typescript\nlet todos = [\n  { title: \"Buy soymilk\", completed: true },\n  { title: \"Write finding indices challenge\", completed: false },\n  { title: \"Bake cookies\", completed: true },\n];\n\n// Before\nconsole.log(todos[index].completed); // false\n\nconst index = todos.findIndex(\n  x => x.title === \"Write finding indices challenge\"\n);\n\ntodos = [\n  ...todos.slice(0, index),\n  {\n    ...todos[index],\n    completed: true,\n  },\n  ...todos.slice(index + 1),\n];\n\n// After\nconsole.log(todos[index].completed); // true\n\n```\n# When is this useful?\n\nBoth of these functions do the same thing, but `findIndex` allows you more flexibility in what you search for. To this end they are both used in the same general case: You have an array and you want to find the index of some item within it.\n\nIf you are dealing with a simple array of strings, numbers, booleans, etc. `indexOf` is likely an easier choice, but `findIndex` can work as well.\n\nIf you are working with an array of objects or other arrays you will need to use `findIndex` to find what you are looking for based on some property of the object or the array. In the example above we used the `title` property to find the todo item we were looking for.\n\n---\n\n**NOTE:** If you just want to check if something exists in an array and you don't care _where_ in the array it is then use `includes`. Since both `findIndex` and `indexOf` return `-1` when something is not found they are less useful with conditional statements. See the following code:\n\n```typescript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 256];\n\n// This will not work, because indexOf(8) is -1 and if (-1) { ... } \n// is equivalent to if (true) { ... }. Only the number 0 is considered\n// false.\nif (numbers.indexOf(8)) {\n  console.log(\"Found 8\"); // This will log even though 8 is not in the array\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Could not find 8\");\n}\n\n// Using includes(8) gives us the answer we expect.\nif (numbers.includes(8)) {\n  console.log(\"Found 8\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Could not find 8\"); // This will log correctly, because 8 is not in the arary\n}\n\n```\n"

          "content": "# From strings to arrays and back again\n\nIt turns out it's very useful to be able to go back and forth between strings and arrays. Many operations are much simpler on arrays or make more sense with arrays than with strings, however, what you ultimately want is a string not an array so you can do the following:\n\n* Convert a string to an array using `split`.\n* Manipulate the array in some way.\n* Convert the array back to a string using `join`.\n\n\nFor example, if you want to be more illegible online you could write a function to uppercase every other letter in your strings.\n\n```typescript\nconst trollSpeak = (str: string) => {\n  return str\n    .split(\"\")\n    .map((x, i) => (i % 2 === 0 ? x.toUpperCase() : x))\n    .join(\"\");\n}\n\nconsole.log(trollSpeak(\"wow it's so nice to be chatting online!\"));\n// => \"WoW It's sO NiCe tO Be cHaTtInG OnLiNe!\"\n\n```\n\nFun\\! What we did here is took a string then did the following steps, just like described above:\n\n1. `split` the string into an array. In this case we `split` on `\"\"` which is an empty string. What this does it it splits all characters of a string separately. Example: `\"wow\".split(\"\");` would give us `[\"w\", \"o\", \"w\"]`\n1. `map` each element of the array. In this case the mapping function calls `toUpperCase` on the string if it's even. Using `i % 2 === 0` is a pretty common pattern to determine if something is even, and in this case we run the uppercase function if it's even. The result is every other character getting uppercased.\n1. `join` the array back into a string. Again we use `\"\"` to join without anything in between. To put it another way we join the elements of the array with an empty string in between.\n\n# When is this useful?\n\nWhenever you want to convert from a string to an array or vice versa. \n\nYou won't always need to convert back to a string either. Sometimes you go from string to array and keep the array. Other times you start with an array of data but you simply want a string. "

In the example above we used the `initialResult` of `0`. Let's walk through what happened one call at a time:\n\n1. First function call: `lastResult` is `0`, `x` is `1` \\(the first element of the array\\), the return value is `1`\n1.

You don't have to worry about array indexing syntax, loop syntax, or when to start and stop your loop.\n* It's directly related to your array. `for` loops can be used with arrays but they have no direct relation. A `for` loop lets you run some code N times where you get to choose what number N is.\n\n\n## Benefits of for loops\n\n* You get to `break` and `continue` in for loops. This can be very important for writing algorithms that run faster because you can skip work if it's not needed. `forEach` does not have this functionality.\n* You can iterate backwards, step\\-wise or any way you want. Using a `for` loop you can iterate backwards through an array, you can iterate over every even number, etc. You are much less constrained in how you loop.\n   * This makes `for` loops more powerful and more flexible than `forEach`, but it also makes `for` loops less well\\-suited to simply iterating over the elements of an array.\n\n\n> **Rule of thumb:** If you're wondering which one to use, try to use `forEach` and if it doesn't work for your use case then fall back to using a `for` loop\\.\n# When is this useful?\n\nWhenever you want to run some code for every element of an array.\n\n**NOTE:** If you want to _transform_ every element of an array it is simpler to use `map` rather than `forEach`."

          "content": "Unfortunately Objects do not give you the same helpful functions as arrays. Namely functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, etc.\n\nTo get around this there are a number of helper functions specifically for Objects that you can use to accomplish these tasks. These functions are:\n\n* `Object.keys`\n   * Returns an array of all _keys_ of an object. `Object.keys({ name: 'Maomi', job: 'Sleeping' })` returns `[\"name\", \"job\"]`.\n* `Object.values`\n   * Returns an array of all _values_ of an object. `Object.values({ name: 'Maomi', job: 'Sleeping' })` returns `[\"Maomi\", \"Sleeping\"]`.\n* `Object.entries`\n   * Returns an array of all **keys and values** of an object. Since it returns a key and a value you will have an array of arrays. `Object.entries({ name: 'Maomi', job: 'Sleeping' })` returns `[[\"name\", \"Maomi\"], [\"Job\", \"Sleeping\"]]`.\n\n\nThis may seem a bit roundabout, and it is, but it's what's built\\-in for you to use. You can always write your own helper functions that allow you to map over arrays and objects the same way.\n# A common pattern\n\nJust as we can operate on strings by converting to an array and back again, we can do the same with objects. The implementation is a bit more cumbersome than with strings but the underlying idea is the same:\n\n1. Use `Object.entries` to convert an object into an array of key\\-value pairs.\n1. Operate on the array of key\\-value pairs using whatever array methods you like\n1. Use `reduce` to convert the array of key\\-value pairs into an object\n\n\nLet's see an example. We'll use a simplified `cities` object from the challenge:\n\n```typescript\nconst cities = {\n  \"New York\": {\n    primaryLanguage: \"English\",\n    population: 8336817,\n  },\n  Tokyo: {\n    primaryLanguage: \"Japanese\",\n    population: 13942856,\n  },\n  Taipei: {\n    primaryLanguage: \"Mandarin\",\n    population: 2646204,\n  },\n};\n\n// 1) Turn the object into key-value pairs\nconst pairs = Object.entries(cities);\n\n// This is entirely made up, but we'll say a city is \"huge\" \n// if it has more than 5 million people\nconst isHuge = x => x.population > 5000000;\n\n// 2) Operate on the key-value pairs. In this case assign\n// a \"huge\" property to every object. true means the city\n// has more than 5 million people.\nconst mappedPairs = pairs.map(([k, v]) => {\n  const newValue = { ...v, huge: isHuge(v) };\n  return [k, newValue]\n});\n\n// 3) Use reduce to turn the pairs back into an object\nconst mappedCities = mappedPairs.reduce((agg, [k, v]) => {\n  return { ...agg, [k]: v };\n}, {});\n\nconsole.log(mappedCities); // The result will look like what's below\n// {\n//   \"New York\": {\n//     primaryLanguage: \"English\",\n//     population: 8336817,\n//     huge: true,\n//   },\n//   Tokyo: {\n//     primaryLanguage: \"Japanese\",\n//     population: 13942856,\n//     huge: true,\n//   },\n//   Taipei: {\n//     primaryLanguage: \"Mandarin\",\n//     population: 2646204,\n//     huge: false,\n//   },\n// }\n\n```\n\nSince converting from an array of key\\-value pairs is fairly common, you could even create a helper function to do it for you:\n\n```typescript\ntype KeyValuePairs = [string, any][];\n\nconst fromPairs = (x: KeyValuePairs) => x.reduce((agg, [k, v]) => {\n  return { ...agg, [k]: v };\n}, {});\n\n// Now you can use this fromPairs function on an array of key-value pairs.\n// The code below essentially does nothing because fromPairs is the inverse\n// operation of Object.entries\nfromPairs(Object.entries({ isObject: true })); // => { isObject: true }\n\n```\n# When is this useful?\n\nWhenever you want to use array functions on an object. For example, if you want to `map`, `filter`, or `reduce` elements of an object."

          "content": "Let's talk about changes. Mutation refers to modifying data. Let's jump right in to an example:\n# Example: Mutable Arrays\n\n```typescript\nconst a = [];\nconst b = a;\nconsole.log(a, b); // [] []\nconsole.log(a === b); // true\n\n```\n\nHere we have an array `a` and a variable `b` set to the same array. `a` is equal to `b` \\(not surprising\\) and the array is currently empty but we can change that.\n\n```typescript\na.push(\"ch-ch-changes!\");\nconsole.log(a, b); // [\"ch-ch-changes!\"] [\"ch-ch-changes!\"]\nconsole.log(a === b); // true\n\n```\n\nThe array has changed and it is _still the same array_. Is it obvious that the second `console.log` would return `true`? Moreover, is it obvious that `b` is _also_ changed when we changed `a`? Regardless, the array has changed despite still being the same array. In fact, we would say ++it has been mutated++. Arrays are mutable, meaning they can change without becoming a new array. \n\nThis is still a bit abstract, so let's look at another example.\n# Example: Immutable Strings\n\n```typescript\nlet c = \"hello\";\nlet d = c;\nconsole.log(c, d); // \"hello\" \"hello\"\nconsole.log(c === d); // true\n\n```\n\nHere we have a string `c` and another variable `d` equal to the same string. `c` and `d` are very unsurprisingly equal. Now, just like with the array we can change our string. You may have also noticed that we used `let` rather than `const` here\\. We'll get to that in a moment.\n\n```typescript\nc = c + \" world\";\nconsole.log(c, d); // \"hello world\" \"hello\"\nconsole.log(c === d); // false\n\n```\n\nHere we modified `c` by appending `\" world\"` to the end, but `d` remains unchanged. This also seems like the expected behavior, but why is it different for strings and arrays. Furthermore, we had to _reassign_ `c` in order to change it. There is no equivalent of `push` for strings. \n\nStrings are immutable, meaning that you cannot change strings—you cannot mutate strings. You can create new strings and you can change what string a variable is assigned to, but you do not change the string itself.\n\nTo further highlight this difference, consider the following example. Although arrays are mutable we do not _have to_ mutate them:\n\n```typescript\nlet e = [\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]\nlet f = e;\nconsole.log(e === f); // true\ne = e.concat([\" \", \"w\", \"o\", \"r\", \"l\", \"d\"]);\nconsole.log(e === f); // false\n\n```\n\nHere we see that we updated `e` without changing the underlying array and without changing `f`. The key is that we _created a new array_ rather than mutating the existing array.\n# Immutability\n\nImmutable types cannot be mutated. They are generally simpler to work with because you **always know** they cannot be mutated. Whenever you are operating on a string you know that if you change the string a new string is created.\n\nMutable types can be mutated. This generally means you have to be more careful when working with mutable types in certain ways. A common mistake is to assume that `array1 === array2` will be `false` if one of the arrays change. This is not true. If the two variables reference the same array they will remain equal even as the array changes.\n# Mutable and Immutable Methods\n\nAs you saw above, some array methods mutate the array and some do not. In general, most array methods **do not** mutate the array. `map`, `filter`, `reduce` for example all create array copies and do not mutate the array. However, some do. Most notably, the `push` method will modify the array rather than create a copy.\n# Mutability Reference\n\nHere are the common types you will be interacting with and whether or not they can be mutated.\n| **Type** | **Mutable?** |\n|:--- |:--- |\n| `string` | No |\n| `number` | No |\n| `boolean` | No |\n| Array | ⚠️ Yes |\n| Object | ⚠️ Yes |\n# Tradeoffs of Mutability\n\nAs with anything in engineering there are tradeoffs to immutable or mutable data types. However, a quick note:\n\n> The benefits and tradeoffs will be less apparent until you start programming larger programs.\n\nThe course challenges are intentionally designed to be roughly bite\\-sized to introduce concepts quickly and provide immediate feedback. However, much of the benefits of immutability and the drawbacks only become viscerally apparent in a larger codebase.\n\n## Immutability Benefits\n\nThe big benefit of immutable data is it makes for much simpler programs. It's easier to reason about data flow when you know that your data cannot change—new data can be created but none of your variables will secretly get updated without you knowing.\n\n## Immutability Drawbacks\n\nThe big drawback of immutability is performance. Immutable data means your program will use more memory for duplicate data and will spend more CPU power copying data. However, modern computers \\(including mobile devices\\) are _extremely_ powerful and have no problem copying data or using slightly more memory.\n\n> In short, immutability will have no performance impact on mobile devices or the web.\n\nIt's still quite possible to write slow code and to bring even modern devices to a grinding halt by writing terrible software, but the point is it is our mistakes as programmers that cause these issues not the immutable data we use.\n\nIf later in your career you decide to start programming low\\-level systems like operating systems or ATM machines then you will care much more about performance, but you will also know much more by then so you will be able to tackle the problem.\n# Mutation is not reassignment\n\n\n## Mutation\n\nIn this example the second `console.log` is not what we would initially expect. Why? `jarbles` was directly modified but `bestFriend` was not, not directly. However, `bestFriend` has indeed changed along with `jarbles`. This may not seem all that bad, or even undesirable, but the issue is that in a real project you might have 100 lines of of code between the first `console.log` and the second. It's much simpler to be able to guarantee that a variable has not changed than it is to worry about what it might be.\n\n```typescript\nconst jarbles = { name: \"Jarbles\", job: \"Cat Trainer\" };\nconst bestFriend = jarbles;\nconsole.log(`My best friend is ${bestFriend.name}!`);\n\njarbles.job = \"Cow Tipper\"; // Oh oh... \n\nconsole.log(`My friend really loves cats, their job is ${bestFriend.job}`)\n\n```\n\n## Reassignment\n\nReassignment is much easier to avoid than mutation because you can simply use `const` to ensure a variable is never reassigned. In fact, this is why we always use `const` instead of `let` unless something is specifically going to be reassigned. This practice ensures that neither you nor someone else working on your code with you accidentally reassigns something that shouldn't be.\n\n```\nconst jarbles = { name: \"Jarbles\", job: \"Cat Trainer\" };\nconst bestFriend = jarbles;\nconsole.log(`My best friend is ${bestFriend.name}!`);\n\n// No way Bongle! This will break the code so there's no inserting yourself here\nbestFriend = { name: \"Bongle\" };\n\nconsole.log(`My friend really loves cats, their job is ${bestFriend.job}`)\n\n```\n# Best Practices\n\nThe best practices are simple:\n\n* Avoid mutation whenever possible.\n   * When working with arrays and objects use immutable methods or the spread operator to make changes without mutation.\n* Avoid reassignment whenever possible. \n   * Always use `const` unless you explicitly want to reassign something, in which case use `let`.\n\n\nMutation and reassignment are not bad, they allow for different solutions to different problems, however they come at the cost of cognitive overhead. Sometimes that cost is worth paying and sometimes its unavoidable.\n\nThe advice of this author is simply to be mindful of your data and deliberate with mutations and reassignments. \n# Functional Programming and Object\\-Oriented Programming\n\nMutability and immutability are often closely intertwined with the two primary language paradigms as follows:\n\n* Object\\-oriented programming loves mutability \\(or at least depends on it\\)\n* Functional programming loves immutability\n\n\n## Classes and Mutation\n\nThis is in large part due to the idioms of these two types of programming. Classes themselves have no meaning without the notion of internal state, and the defining feature of state is that it changes over time. Thus you generally won't find classes without much mutation. Sometimes they are used simply as namespaces, but in that case there are more direct mechanisms such as simple objects or modules so classes are still primarily useful in the context of state and mutation. \n\n## Functions and Immutability\n\nFunctions on the other hand are concerned with input and output. You pass in arguments and you get a return value. When you want to do complex things you write many functions and hook them all together end to end. We will see how to do this in the [functional programming](/workspace/jxRxi1j5A) section\\.\n\nA function certainly could mutate it's arguments and pass them back \\(or not\\) but that's usually clumsy to write when you're expected to return a value. Furthermore a function that modifies its arguments is no longer pure and thus breaks purity guarantees that many functional programming principles depend on.\n# Immutability and Programming Languages\n\nIn this course we are concerned with TypeScript, which shares all the mutability characteristics of JavaScript as described here. However it is worth noting that other languages have different approaches to mutability.\n\nPrimarily object\\-oriented languages such as Ruby and Python tend more towards mutability, in large part simply because using classes is the idiomatic way to solve problems.\n\nPrimarily functional languages such as Clojure and Haskell have immutability built in to the language itself \\(think arrays and objects that cannot be mutated\\).\n\nJavaScript \\(and thus TypeScript\\) is a bit of an oddball language in this respect because you can choose to write highly functional code or highly object\\-oriented code. It's extremely flexible, which is both a blessing and a curse. Throughout your travels when reading code in the wild you may well discover you have no idea what's going on because the author created a bunch of abstractions you're unfamiliar with."

          "content": "# The Spread Operator\n\nGiven all this talk of mutating objects and arrays it's time to talk about how to make updates without mutating the original data. For example, consider the following object:\n\n```typescript\nconst person = { name: \"Jenna\", role: \"Management\" };\n\n```\n\nJenna has decided to break away from all the \"J\" names in her company and so she's changing her name to `\"Gemma\"`. How could we update the object to reflect this? The mutative way, the easy way is to just assign a new name on the object:\n\n```typescript\nperson.name = \"Gemma\";\nconsole.log(person); // { name: \"Gemma\", role: \"Management\" }\n\n```\n\nThis certainly accomplishes the update we want, but if we wanted to do it without mutation we need a new approach.\n# Enter the Spread Operator\n\nThere is a nifty operator called the spread operator which let's you extend or overwrite objects. The syntax is as follows \\(notice the `...`\\):\n\n```typescript\nconst updatedPerson = {\n  ...person,\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n};\nconsole.log(person); // { name: \"Jenna\", role: \"Management\" }\nconsole.log(updatedPerson); // { name: \"Gemma\", role: \"Management\" }\n\n```\n\nAs you can see the `person` object hasn't changed.\n# Order is important\n\nWhen using the spread operator it's very important to know what order you want to use it in. For example:\n\n```typescript\nconst person = { name: \"Jenna\", role: \"Management\" };\nconst a = {\n  ...person,\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n};\nconst b = {\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n  ...person,\n};\nconsole.log(a); // { name: \"Gemma\", role: \"Management\" }\nconsole.log(b); // { name: \"Jenna\", role: \"Management\" }\n\n```\n\nUsing the spread operator on an object will overwrite whatever came before. So if `person` has a `name` property it will overwrite any `name` property created earlier in the object. If this is not clear let's use some more verbose code to explain. \n\nHere are two equivalent ways to create an object:\n\n```\n// This is the standard way to create an object, but the two forms of \n// creating an object below are equivalent.\nconst a = { name: \"Gemma\" };\n\n// This will result in the same object as above, but it's more verbose\n// and requires more code.\nconst a = {};\na.name = \"Gemma\"\n\n```\nNote: This code wouldn't run in an editor because the constant `a` is defined twice, but it's just for demonstration purposes here.\n\nHere are two ways to give `a` all the properties of `person`:\n\n```\nconst a = {\n  ...person,\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n};\n\n// equivalent to this code\nconst a = {};\na.name = person.name;\na.role = person.role;\na.name = \"Gemma\";\n\n```\n\nNow let's look at the code with the order of `...person` changed so that it comes afterwards.\n\n```\nconst a = {\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n  ...person,\n};\n\n// equivalent to this code\nconst a = {};\na.name = \"Gemma\";\na.name = person.name;\na.role = person.role;\n\n```\n \nChanging the order has completely changed the ultimate value of `a.name`."

This is a side effect.\n\n\nBy being impure `impureIncrement` loses one of the core features of functions: Reusability. The function depends on the `count` variable so it can't be used in other parts of our code where `count` is not accessible.\n\nLet's look at a pure increment function and compare the differences:\n\n```typescript\nlet count = 0;\n\nconst pureIncrement = (n: number) => {\n  return n + 1;\n};\n\nconsole.log(pureIncrement(count)); // 1\nconsole.log(count); // 0\n\n```\n\nIn contrast to `impureIncrement`, `pureIncrement` does not depend on any variables outside its scope and it doesn't have any side effects. You'll notice that the second time we log `count` it hasn't changed at all. If we want to change `count` we can easily do so by reassigning it:\n\n```typescript\ncount = pureIncrement(count);\n\n```\n# The Case for Pure Functions\n\n\n## Simplicity\n\nWhen dealing with pure functions you are able to ignore _all other code_ while working on them, because you know the only variables relevant to the output are in the function itself. Not having to worry about other code can save you a huge amount of mental energy and anyone else working on your code with you will thank you for making their lives easier too.\n\n## Reusability\n\nPure code is reusable code. All that matters is the input arguments match the required type.\n\n## Testability\n\nThis likely won't mean much now because we haven't covered automated testing yet, but it's an important benefit that we will touch on much more later in the course.\n\nIt's extremely easy to automatically test pure functions so that you will immediately know if they every break do to changes in your code.\n# The Necessity of Side Effects\n\n> This section may read as if side effects are a bad thing and that is simply not the case. Side effects are not bad, they are necessary. However, the tone of this article comes from the **_overuse_** of side effects. When side effects are not needed, they should be avoided. \n\nSide effects are necessary to create interesting software. To make this point clear, let's consider some side effects that software can perform:\n\n* Saving information to a database\n* Sending an email\n* Making a phone call\n* Buying or selling stocks\n* Ordering a package\n\n\nSide effects are inherent in useful software because side effects are how we interact with the world. Software without side effects would not be able to interact with the world, and thus would not be useful to us.\n\nAvoid side effects where possible, be deliberate with them where necessary.\n\n---\n# Appendix\n\n\n## Pure Functions and Class Methods\n\nClasses and pure functions often coexist in the same codebase, but because classes are inherently stateful they do lend themselves to functional purity.\n\n### Instance Methods\n\n**TL;DR:** Instance methods and pure functions are _incompatible_.\n\nLet's consider some examples:\n\n```typescript\nclass Incrementor {\n  n: number;\n\n  constructor(n: number) {\n    this.n = n;\n  }\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.n += 1;\n  };\n}\n\nconst incrementor = new Incrementor(0);\nconsole.log(incrementor.n); // 0\nincrementor.increment();\nconsole.log(incrementor.n); // 1\n\n```\n\nIt may be tempting to think that the `increment` method of `Incrementor` is pure because it only operates on its own class, but this is not true. The reason is, we have no guarantees about the value of `this.n`. It is just as bad as an external variable for purity because not only can other methods of `Incrementor` modify `n` but _any code at all_ with access to the instance can.\n\n```typescript\nclass Incrementor {\n  n: number;\n\n  constructor(n: number) {\n    this.n = n;\n  }\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.n += 1;\n  };\n}\n\nconst incrementor = new Incrementor(0);\nconsole.log(incrementor.n); // 0\nincrementor.increment();\nconsole.log(incrementor.n); // 1 \n\n// Directly modify n\nincrementor.n = 87;\nincrementor.increment();\nconsole.log(incrementor.n); // 88\n\n```\n\nWe've changed the return value of `incrementor.increment()` without changing it's arguments\\! This is not OK for a pure function.\n\nYou may be thinking surely can just make `n` a private instance property and thus disallow access from the outside world. Then we will have a pure function\\! Unfortunately in that case there are still two problems:\n\n* JavaScript\\. Your own TypeScript codebase will respect `private` properties but any code that you import into you application from JavaScript that has access to `incrementor` could still update the value.\n* Instance methods. We didn't include any other instance methods above but maybe someone will add some later. Maybe se ourselves will add some later, forgetting that we wanted increment to be a pure function.\n\n\nLet's modify the code to use a private instance method for `n`. We'll also add a `goWild` method to demonstrate the danger of other methods to our would\\-be pure function.\n\n```typescript\nclass Incrementor {\n  // Ooooh so private, the outside world can't change my value!\n  private n: number;\n\n  constructor(n: number) {\n    this.n = n;\n  }\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.n += 1;\n  };\n\n  // Since n is not private, we need a method to access it\n  getN = () => this.n;\n\n  goWild = () => {\n    this.n = Math.random();\n  };\n}\n\nconst incrementor = new Incrementor(0);\nconsole.log(incrementor.getN()); // 0\nincrementor.increment();\nconsole.log(incrementor.getN()); // 1 \n\n// Uh oh...\nincrementor.goWild();\n\nincrementor.increment();\nconsole.log(incrementor.getN()); // ???\n\n```\n\nThere is no way of knowing what the value of `n` will be on the last line, despite the fact the increment was called with the same arguments as before—no arguments. Thus the `increment` method is not a pure function.\n\nIt is very simple to create a  pure increment function:\n\n```\nconst increment = (n: number) => n + 1;\n\n```\n\nHowever, in this case we have no need for a `class`. This is why pure functions and class methods are incompatible.\n\n### Static Methods\n\nUnlike instance methods, static methods can absolutely be pure. Static methods have no instance to access so they can be just as pure or impure as any old function. Let's create a `Calculations` class which will serve as a collection of math calculations:\n\n```typescript\nclass Calculations {\n  static add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;\n  static increment = (n: number) => n + 1;\n};\n\nconsole.log(Calculations.add(2, 3)); // 5\nconsole.log(Calculations.increment(7)); // 8\n\n```\n\nBoth `Calculations.add` and `Calculations.increment` are pure functions. The question here is, what are we using the class for?\n\nIf someone else comes along and wants to use our functions they might do this if they don't read our source code:\n\n```\nconst c = new Calculations();\nconsole.log(c.add(2,3)); // This will break\n\n```\n\nThere's no reason to instantiate the `Calculations` class, it's just a collection of static methods. However, that's not necessarily obvious without reading through the source code and believe me, not everyone reads the source of all the functions they use.\n\nIn this case a more intuitive approach would simply be to use an object:\n\n```typescript\nconst Calculations = {\n  add: (a: number, b: number) => a + b,\n  increment: (n: number) => n + 1,\n};\n\nconsole.log(Calculations.add(2, 3)); // 5\nconsole.log(Calculations.increment(7)); // 8\n\n```\n\nUse your own judgement when working with classes and functions. Sometimes static methods will work best because they are consistent with other code in your codebase. Sometimes they may be entirely unnecessary and a plain object would serve better.\n\nIn general, if something isn't needed then it's best left out. Programming is complex enough without more code lying around that isn't really needed but still runs and could potentially contain bugs."

If you boil JavaScript down, it's actually almost entirely objects and functions \\(see the Appendix for more on this if you're curious\\).\n\nThe aim of this section is to explain how code like this works:\n\n```typescript\n[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n  .map(capitalize)\n  .map(surround(`'`))\n  .map(append(\" is a letter\")); // [\"'A' is a letter\", \"'B' is a letter\", \"'C' is a letter\"]\n\n```\n# Functions as data\n\nAlso known as first\\-class functions, if you like jargon.\n\nFunctions are like any other data type in that they can be passed around and used wherever syntactically valid. The jargon here is \"first\\-class\" meaning that functions are just like any other value in terms of where they can be used.\n\nIn other words, ++functions can be used just like data++.\n\n> **Why do first\\-class functions matter**?\n> First class functions allow you a huge degree of flexibility in your programs. Having first\\-class functions is one of the major defining characteristics of JavaScript and thus of TypeScript too. **Not all** programming languages allow you to use functions in this way.\n\nLook at the first code below. You will see that we are passing a function in to the `map` array method. Since functions are like any other value we can grab it right out of there and assign it to another variable. The following two code snippets are equivalent:\n\n```typescript\n[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].map((letter: string) => letter.toUpperCase()); // => [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n\n```\n\n```typescript\nconst capitalize = (letter: string) => letter.toUpperCase();\n\n[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].map(capitalize); // => [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n\n```\n\nJust like any other value we can also put functions into arrays:\n\n```typescript\nconst capitalize = (letter: string) => letter.toUpperCase();\nconst surroundQuote = (s: string) => `'${s}'`;\nconst appendLetter = (s: string) => `${s} is a letter`;\n\n// Create an array of transformations (functions)\nconst transformations = [capitalize, surroundQuote, appendLetter];\n\nconst result = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].map((letter: string) => {\n  transformations.forEach((transform: Function) => {\n    letter = transform(letter);\n  });\n  return letter;\n});\n\nconsole.log(result);\n// [\"'A' is a letter\", \"'B' is a letter\", \"'C' is a letter\"];\n\n```\n\nFinally, just like any other value we can put functions onto objects. Here's an example creating some helper functions that prepend the type of log operation to the message:\n\n```typescript\nconst Log = {\n  info: (message: string) => console.info(\"[INFO]\" + message),\n  warn: (message: string) => console.info(\"[WARN]\" + message),\n};\nLog.info(\"Log helper created\"); // \"[INFO] Log helper created\"\nLog.warn(\"This helper is not so useful...\"); // \"[WARN] This helper is not so useful...\"\n\n```\n# Simple, but not easy¹\n\nThe idea that functions can be used anywhere just like other values is simple, but it's not easy. Here's what we mean:\n\n* It's **simple** because you don't have to worry about where functions can be used. If you can use any kind of value you can use a function. This means less cognitive overhead worrying about what type can be used where.\n* It's **not easy** because it's unintuitive. We're used to thinking of \n   * **NOTE:** It's unintuitive for _most people_. It is true that some people understand these concepts very quickly. If you are one of those people that's great\\! However, most programmers, including this author, struggled with the idea of first\\-class functions before it finally clicked.\n\n# Higher\\-order Functions\n\nAs a consequence of functions being first\\-class, they can be passed in to other functions and passed back out too. When a function deals with other functions it's called a higher\\-order function.\n\n> **Jargon Tip**: Now that you know of higher\\-order functions you can forget the term until someone brings it up in a programming interview or a pedantry contest. The _idea_ of higher order functions is extremely useful—the jargon less so.\n\n## Functions can take other functions as arguments\n\nYou've already seen this but it may not have been apparent what was going on. Array methods often take functions:\n\n* `map`\n* `filter`\n* `reduce`\n\n\nThese are all examples of functions that take other functions as arguments. As an example:\n\n```typescript\nconst double = (n: number) => n * 2;\n[2,3,4].map(double); // => [4, 6, 8]\n\n```\n\n## Functions can return functions\n\nThis is where things get a bit more interesting and potentially more confusing. Let's just jump right in with an example. Above we had a `double` function that will multiply any number by `2`. What if we wanted some number other than `2`? We can write other functions for other numbers, but we can also write a function that will create other functions.\n\n```typescript\nconst multiplyBy = (n: number) => {\n  // Define our inner function. n is currently available within scope\n  // so we can make use of it in our inner function \n  const multiplyByN = (x: number) => {\n    return n * x;\n  };\n\n  // Return the new function\n  return multiplyByN;\n};\n\n```\n\nNow we can use this `multiplyBy` function to define new functions for us. Rewriting the doubling example above:\n\n```\nconst double = multiplyBy(2);\n[2,3,4].map(double); // => [4, 6, 8]\n\n```\n\nIf we're not going to reuse the `double` function we can make this even less verbose:\n\n```\n[2,3,4].map(multiplyBy(2)); // => [4, 6, 8]\n\n```\n\n**NOTE:** Another way you will often see these functions written is in this more concise way. Here's our rewritten `multiplyBy` function\\.\n\n```\nconst multiplyBy = (n: number) => (x: number) => n * x;\n\n```\n\nRevisiting our string transformation functions from above, we can rewrite them to make them more reusable. Here was the original code. `capitalize` is not going to change, but the other two can be rewritten to allow surrounding with any string and appending any string.\n\n```\n// Original code\nconst capitalize = (letter: string) => letter.toUpperCase();\nconst surroundQuote = (s: string) => `'${s}'`;\nconst appendLetter = (s: string) => `${s} is a letter`;\nconst transformations = [capitalize, surroundQuote, appendLetter];\n\n// New code. capitalize remains the same\nconst surround = (s: string) => (x: string) => s + x + s;\nconst append = (s: string) => (x: string) => x + s;\nconst transformations = [capitalize, surround(`'`), append(\" is a letter\")];\n\n```\n# Why?\n\nThis may all seem a bit crazy and even _less readable_ than before, but there's a reason many programmers use this style.\n\n## Declarative Code\n\nDeclarative code is more concerned with the \"what\" than the \"how\" which can often make it very easy to read, at least once you're familiar with this programming style. It's very easy to get caught up in the nitty gritty details while programming. Declarative programming is all about creating abstractions that make it easier to not worry about the \"how\" so you can focus on \"what\" you want instead.\n\nLet's revisit the example from above. In English we might say:\n\n1. Capitalize each letter\n1. Surround each letter with a single quote\n1. Append \" is a letter\" to the end of the string \n\n\nNow let's look at some code again:\n\n```typescript\n[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n  .map((x) => x.toUpperCase())\n  .map((x) => `'${x}'`)\n  .map((x) => x + \" is a letter\"); // [\"'A' is a letter\", \"'B' is a letter\", \"'C' is a letter\"]\n\n```\n\nThere's certainly nothing wrong with this code. It's concise and direct. However, a more declarative approach might make it more clear what each step is doing:\n\n```typescript\n[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n  .map(capitalize)\n  .map(surround(`'`))\n  .map(append(\" is a letter\")); // [\"'A' is a letter\", \"'B' is a letter\", \"'C' is a letter\"]\n\n```\n\nUltimately some of this comes down to personal choice. How you choose to write your own code is highly subjective and you should pursue whatever you enjoy at the time while still being open to new styles.\n\nRegardless of how you enjoy programming you will eventually read code in many different styles so it will help to be familiar with many.\n\n---\n# Appendix\n\n\n## Simple vs. Easy\n\nI've borrowed this particular distinction from the seminal talk [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/) by Rich Hickey, the creator of the [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) programming language. Clojure, unsurprisingly, is a functional programming language that incorporates this idea of striving for code that is simple rather than easy.\n\nThe idea is that there's a strong distinction between what is simple and what is quick or within reach.\n\n* Simple: Lacking exceptions. Not interconnected or dependent on other conditions.\n   * Being able to use functions as data is simple because you can use other values as data. You don't have to worry about whether or not something is a function to add it to an array for example.\n* Easy: Within reach, nearby. Relating to things we already know.\n   * Using functions as data is not easy because we lack mental context for it. Using functions as a set of steps to complete **is easy** because we have context for this. \n\n\n### Sometimes you can have both\n\nSimple and easy are not mutually exclusive, but they are often in opposition in the world of programming.\n\n## Classes before the class keyword\n\nLet's create a simple `Person` class\\.\n\n```\nclass Person {\n  constructor(props) {\n    this.name = props.name;\n    this.role = props.role;\n  }\n\n  getDescription = () => {\n    return `${this.name} works in ${this.role}`;\n  }\n}\n\nconst jim = new Person({ name: 'Jim', role: 'Sales' });\n\nconsole.log(jim.getDescription()); // Jim works in Sales\n\n```\n\nHowever, did you know that classes are actually functions? In the past, classes were only classes because of the `new` keyword which could be applied to functions. Here's how you could create a `Person` class without using the `class` keyword\\.\n\n```\nfunction Person(props) {\n  this.name = props.name;\n  this.role = props.role;\n\n  this.getDescription = () => {\n    return `${this.name} works in ${this.role}`;\n  };\n}\n\nconst jim = new Person({ name: 'Jim', role: 'Sales' });\n\nconsole.log(jim.getDescription()); // Jim works in Sales\n\n```\n\nThese two examples will give you the same result.\n\n> **NOTE:** Although you can create classes this way you absolutely should use the `class` keyword when creating classes. It makes for much clearer code, which is part of why the `class` keyword was created and added to the language.\n"

The job of this function is to format a number as a percent \\(ex: 12.50%\\). Let's update that function to do more than just append a `%` sign\\. Here's all the relevant code from before:\n\n```typescript\nconst append = (s: string) => (x: string | number) => x + s;\nconst formatPercent = append(\"%\");\nformatPercent(.73); // => \".73%\"\nformatPercent(.2); // => \".2%\"\nformatPercent(.256); // => \".256%\"\n\n```\n\nNow let's say we want our `formatPercent` function to: \n\n* Multiply by 100, so `.2` becomes `20`, `.256` becomes `25.6`, etc. At the beginning of this section we talked about a `multiplyBy` function\\. We can reuse that function here.\n* Ensure there are 2 decimal places. Numbers have a built\\-in way to do this using `.toFixed`. Example: `(3).toFixed(2)` will give us `\"3.00\"`.\n\n# Creating a Function Pipeline\n\nUnfortunately there's no built\\-in way to create a pipeline of functions so we have to create our own solution. That solution will be the `pipe` function\\. We won't talk about how to write that function yet because we want to focus on what it lets us do:\n\n```typescript\n// First lets wrap the toFixed method\nconst toFixed = (decimalPlaces: number) => (n: number) => n.toFixed(decimalPlaces);\n\n// Now we will create a pipeline of functions\nconst formatPercent = pipe(\n  multiplyBy(100),\n  toFixed(2),\n  append(\"%\")\n);\n\n```\n\nNotice how we combined three functions together to form a new one. This is what the `pipe` function lets us do. We'll go over `pipe` in more detail in a future lesson.\n\n\n## Why not a \"normal\" function?\n\nLet's rewrite the code above to use a more traditional approach:\n\n```typescript\n// First lets wrap the toFixed method\nconst toFixed = (decimalPlaces: number) => (n: number) => n.toFixed(decimalPlaces);\n\nconst formatPercent = (input: number) => {\n  let result = input;\n  \n  result = multiplyBy(100)(result);\n  result = toFixed(2)(result);\n  result = append(\"%\")(result);\n  \n  return result;\n};\n\n```\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this approach, but it's more work for you as the programmer:\n\n* You will need one or more new variables. In this case we used `input` and `result`. These variables are not needed when we use `pipe`.\n* You need to assign your variables and return a result manually. Notice that in the `pipe` version we never have to use the `=` symbol to assign anything or the `return` keyword to return anything.\n\n\nIn other words, using `pipe` our function becomes more concise. It is indeed harder to understand at first—this is normal. It really becomes useful once you're used to writing functions composed of other functions.\n\n> **Recommendation:** Use whatever approach is easier for you to understand. It's most important that you _write code_, no matter how you write it. Once you've written lots and lots of code you can start experiment with different coding styles. \n"

          "content": "Classes in TypeScript provide a way for grouping shared state and behavior in a single entity. What do we mean? Consider this class:\n\n### A Box Class\n\n```\n// Define a class which has the properities of a box\nclass Box {\n    constructor(width: number, height: number, depth: number){\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n        this.depth = depth;\n    }\n}\n\n// Create a new instance of a Box\nconst box = new Box(5, 10, 25);\n\n// Inspect the box\nconsole.log(box.width); // => 5\nconsole.log(box.height); // => 10\nconsole.log(box.depth); // => 25\n\n```\n\nWe have defined a class `Box` using the `class` keyword\\. We then create a new instance of a `Box` and inspect the box's width, height, and depth. There are a few new things here, which we will explain and practice. But first, what is the point of creating a structure like this?\n\n### Object Oriented Programming\n\nA discipline of programming called \"object oriented programming\" took the programming world by storm several decades ago. The basic premise of object oriented programming is that you can use \"objects\" to encapsulate common state and behavior. These objects can be composed and used to create more complex systems and behavior, but, individually everything would always reduce to small, single responsibility, encapsulated, decoupled objects \\(which could also be easily tested\\).\n\nIt's a great vision\\! In practice, object oriented programming turned out to not be a silver bullet for all software design.\n\nHowever, it is a very useful and powerful practice in many situations, and object oriented programming skills are definitely important to be familiar with. It's a tool you can productively use to solve many problems.\n\nWhile the complete story of how object oriented programming has evolved in JavaScript/TypeScript is out of the scope of this lesson, suffice it to say that ECMAScript 6 has introduced more traditional object\\-oriented classes to JavaScript, which TypeScript builds upon to support the type of object orientated capabilities programmers coming from other object oriented languages are more familiar with.\n\n### TypeScript Classes\n\nWhen building classes you will commonly provide a `constructor` function, which sets property values on the class, and member methods, which provide functionality and behavior associated with that class. Consider this more developed `Box`:\n\n```\nclass Box {\n  // These are properties\n  width: number;\n  height: number;\n  depth: number;\n\n  // This is the constructor\n  constructor(width: number, height: number, depth: number) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    this.depth = depth;\n  }\n\n  // This is a member method\n  getDimensions() {\n    return {\n      width: this.width,\n      height: this.height,\n      depth: this.depth,\n    };\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe `constructor` is called a single time when the class is first instantiated. A class is instantiated using the `new` keyword, and a class can be instantiated multiple times. Multiple instantiated classes are all separate \"instances\" of the original class. When a class is instantiated, the constructor is responsible for setting up the class and performing any initialization which is required. The constructor can accept arguments which it will use during initialization.\n\nClass properties are values stored on the class itself which can be used to track internal class state. For the box, these properties track the box dimensions.\n\nFinally, member methods are just functions which are attached to the class. These functions typically provide behavior associated with the class. They may set or update internal class state, or provide some behavior. In the box example above, there is one member method, `getDimensions`, which returns the box's dimensions.\n\n### The \"this\" Keyword\n\nThere is a complicated history associated with the `this` keyword in JavaScript. For the sake of total simplicity, here is the only thing you need to know right now:\n\n* Use `this` inside of a class method or its constructor and it refers to the current instance of that class.\n\n\nIn the above examples, `this` is used to reference the current instance of the class. It's like saying \"give me _this_ class\". You can use the `this` keyword inside a class to access properties and class members which are attached to that class.\n\n### Encapsulation\n\nOne traditional principle with object oriented programming is that objects should encapsulate state and operations and they should expose a public API for consumers to use. Most traditional object oriented languages directly support this separation between \"public\" and \"private\" class properties and methods, and so does TypeScript\\! As a side note, the same is not possible in JavaScript.\n\nClass values which are \"private\" are not available to the outside world, while \"public\" properties or methods can be accessed directly by outside code. This allows you to keep the internal implementation of a class cleanly separated from how other code will \"use\" your class. In general, this is useful and a good practice. Consider our box one last time:\n\n```\nclass Box {\n  // These are properties\n  private width: number;\n  private height: number;\n  private depth: number;\n\n  // This is the constructor\n  constructor(width: number, height: number, depth: number) {\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    this.depth = depth;\n  }\n\n  // This is a member method\n  public getDimensions() {\n    return {\n      width: this.width,\n      height: this.height,\n      depth: this.depth,\n    };\n  }\n}\n\nconst box = new Box(5, 5, 5);\nconsole.log(box.width);\n// -> Property 'width' is private and only accessible\n// within class 'Box'.(2341)\n\n```\n\nWe have added the `public` and `private` keywords within the class, and then tried to access `box.width` after instantiating a new class. The following comment shows the error TypeScript would display if you tried to do this. The `width` property is `private` and cannot be accessed outside of the `Box` class\\!\n\nTypically, an object oriented approach hides data in private instance variables or properties and exposes this data via public accessor methods. The data should not be accessed or \"set\" directly from the outside. Instead, public \"getter\" and \"setter\" methods are exposed to control these operations.\n\n### OOP Principles\n\nObject oriented programming \\(OOP\\) has an entire ideological history behind it. Without getting into the details here are three powerful OOP principles which have wide ranging application throughout all of programming:\n\n* **Encapsulation:** As demonstrated above, encapsulation is the principle of hiding data and exposing public getter/setter methods for reading and writing data from/to objects.\n* **Abstraction: **Abstraction is the principle of expressing the \"intention\" or \"shape\"/\"behavior\" of a class separately from its actual implementation. In TypeScript, this can be achieved using interfaces to define the shape of a class and then implementing interfaces using the `implements` keyword\\.\n* **Inheritance:** Inheritance is the principle of creating objects which \"inherit\" state or behavior from parent objects. Inheritance allows you to share functionality, compose objects together, better organize code, and create more complex structures. For instance, in the above examples you might imagine a base `Shape` class which our box `extends`, or inherits from.\n\n\nObject oriented programming is a diverse and powerful discipline of programming, with a lot to get into. For this section, we will focus on covering the basics of classes in TypeScript and getting familiar with building some simple classes to represent common everyday objects\\!"

          "content": "Now you have learned all the basics of a programming language\\! Now that you have a solid foundation it's time to put your skills to the test solving some algorithms. These will be simple, and increasingly more challenging, problems that require you to write a function to perform some specific operation or algorithm. To solve them, you will need to have a firm grasp of all the basic programming concepts: conditional statements, loops, data structures, functions, and so on.\n\nSolving a number of questions like this is the best way to build up your programming skills and become confident in your abilities.\n\nA quick note about algorithms: eventually, in your journey as a programmer you may find yourself in an interview where you have to solve algorithm questions, perhaps on a whiteboard or in a coding environment. These can be a hard and challenging part of getting a job as a programmer.\n\nThis section is not meant to be practice for this style of algorithm questions. It is just meant to provide a lot of simple practice putting to use the concepts and skills you have learned in the previous challenges. These algorithms should give you ample practice writing functions, working with arrays, objects, and classes, and experimenting with the language features TypeScript has to offer. By the end, you should be very comfortable writing TypeScript\\!"

That criteria is specified in a function. This makes the `groupBy` function extremely flexible, because you can group by any criteria you want. \n\nFor example, consider the [Counting Word Occurrences](/workspace/0xs07JCP4) challenge\\. In that challenge we wanted to find out how frequently words occurred in a string. Using the `groupBy` function we can get a very similar answer in just a few lines of code:\n\n```\nconst sentence = \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. Remember, the fox was quick.\";\nconst words = sentence.split(\" \");\n\n// Our grouping function will lowercase the string and remove a period if present.\nconst groupingFunction = (x: string) => x.toLowerCase().replace(\".\", \"\");\n\ngroupBy(words, groupingFunction);\n// => \n// { \n//   the: ['The', 'the', 'the'], \n//   quick: ['quick', 'quick.'], \n//   ...etc \n// }\n\n```\n\nAs you can see this approach gives us a list of all occurrences of a word based on our `groupingFunction`, rather than the number of occurrences. To get the number from here we could easily use `.length` on each of the grouped arrays."

The function accepts a `rationLimit` which specifies how much a `Consumer` can receive of some `\"Goods\"`. The `rationLimit` function returns a new function, the `distributor` function\\. This function is called with consumer requests, and accepts a `Consumer` and `requestSize` as arguments. The distributor should provide goods to each consumer until the consumer has received the number of goods equal to the `rationLimit`. Once this limit is reached, no more goods should be returned for the consumer. Consumers are identified using their unique `id` attribute\\.\n\nThe goods are rationed because they are scarce\\! The `rationer` also accepts a second argument, `totalGoods`, which specifies the total supply of the good being rationed. Once this amount has been distributed, no more goods should be distributed, even to new consumers.\n\nWhen the goods are depleted, or when a consumer has reached their limit, the distributor should return `null`. If the goods are not depleted yet, the distributor should return as many goods as possible based on the request \\(in an array\\). For instance, if a consumer requests 10 goods, but the total goods supply is five, the distributor should return 5 goods: `[\"Goods\", \"Goods\", \"Goods\", \"Goods\", \"Goods\"]`.

          "instructions": "For this project, we will implement a class which represents a game board. You can think of the board like a grid where each space is represented by `x` and `y` coordinates\\. The `GameBoardNavigator` should expose a method `movePlayer` which accepts a `playerId` and a direction argument. The board will track the positions of players and allow the players to move around.\n\nThe game board class should satisfy these properties:\n\n* The board can be instantiated with a size and list of players, see constructor type definition below.\n* Players can be moved using a `movePlayer` method, see definition below.\n* The definition of a player includes an `id`, `y`, and `x` fields\\. The id is unique, and the y and x values represent the player's position on the board.\n* Two players cannot occupy the same square.\n* Players cannot occupy squares outside of the board dimensions.\n* Attempting to move a player to a square which is occupied or invalid will throw an error.\n* Player ids are unique: the board constructor will throw an error if multiple players are received with the same id.\n* The game board provides a method `getPlayers` which returns all of the players currently on the board.\n\n\n```\n// Constructor method:\ntype ConstructorMethod = (boardSize: number, players: Player[]): void;\n\n// Move player method:\ntype MovePlayerFunction = (playerId: string, direction: string) => void;\n// Where direction should be \"left\", \"right\", \"up\", or \"down\".\n\n// Get players method to return all the players with their current positions on the board\ntype GetPlayersFunction = () => Player[];\n\n```\n\nYou are free to implement the class anyway you want as long as it satisfies the above constraints\\! An obvious solution is to use a 2 dimensional array. Could you build a different solution?\n\nTry to think about code organization, readability, and extensibility as you design your solution.

          "content": "# Schools of thought\n\n* How you write your software\n* How you architect it\n* How you think about it\n\n\nThat's what we're talking about today.\n# A classic dichotomy\n\nHumans have a tendency to separate complex subjects into two oversimplified groups and programmers, being human, are no different.\n\nWe often group programs under the following two banners:\n\n* Object Oriented Programming \\(OOP\\)\n   * We have a section about this: [Classes](/workspace/uyjd$DG@$)\n* Functional Programming \\(FP\\)\n   * We also have a section about this: [Functional Programming](/workspace/jxRxi1j5A)\n\n\n## A very qualitative comparison\n\nLet's take a look at some of the characteristics of the two approaches in a very qualitative way. \n|  | **OOP** | **FP** |\n|:--- |:--- |:--- |\n| Amount of code | More | Less |\n| Use of state | Maximized | Minimized |\n| Approachability | 8/10 | 5/10 |\n| Ease of testing | 5/10 | 9/10 |\n| Code Composability | 3/10 | 10/10 |\n\n#### Amount of code\n\nOOP code tends to be longer than FP code. This is because FP code is mostly functions. OOP code will have many functions too, but they will usually be methods of classes which means more code generally speaking.\n\nThis is neither good or bad. The guideline around code length is to be concise. In other words, write code that is clear and readable, and do it with as little code as possible. Clear and readable is the priority here, not the amount of code.\n\n#### Use of state\n\nAdding state makes functions less composable and less predicable, so FP code tends to try to relegate state to one part of the app and nowhere else. OOP code _tends_ to be the opposite. In TypeScript there's no need for classes unless you need state, so it stands to reason that when you already have classes everywhere you'd be more tempted to add state.\n\nClasses can be used very effectively for functional programming, so the statement that OOP maximizes state usage is a tendency but certainly not a rule.\n\n#### Approachability\n\nOOP lends itself to human intuitions about the world better than functional programming. \n\n* OOP is hierarchical. Hierarchies are a familiar concept be it from biology or workplace boss\\-employee relationships.\n* OOP is all about nouns while FP is all about verbs. In the real world we think of nouns \\(people, animals, houses, etc..\\) and verbs as closely associated. A person walks, a dog barks. In the land of FP your verbs operate on various forms of data, which is much less intuitive.\n\n\nFurthermore, OOP is more prevalent so it's more likely a new student to programming has encountered OOP in some form even without knowing it.\n\nFP isn't necessarily unintuitive to begin with, but once you start getting into [higher order functions](/workspace/jxRxi1j5A#h-higher-order-functions) and recursion there's a bit of a learning curve.\n\n#### Ease of testing\n\nWe'll get into this later in the course, but the simple truth is that it's easier to test functions that it is to test classes. Testing your code means it will break less, which means less work for Future You.\n\n#### Code composability\n\nComposition is even more powerful than simple code reusability, which often means using a function to do the same thing in more than one place in a codebase. Composability on the other hand is about reusing existing code to create new logic and new results. It's not just about avoiding extra typing, it's about building your own abstractions that can be reused in many places.\n\nThink of the array methods as an example. You have methods like `join`, `slice`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc. These can all be reused in many different ways. They core functionality is operating on an array in some way, but they don't care whats in the array.\n# Fervent Programmers\n\nWant to get into a heated argument with a programmer? Find out whether they prefer OOP or FP and start extolling the benefits of the other in front of them. Some impassioned arguments may arise.\n\nMany programmers once they've found a way they like to program will stick to it and sometimes even begin to think other ways are inferior. This is fine, everyone's welcome to their opinion, but it may come as a surprise if you thought that we were all cold logicians dispassionately pursuing truth and occasionally writing code.\n# Learn Both\n\nFor two reasons:\n\n1. You can't judge which you prefer, let alone which is better, without knowing both styles.\n1. You have to. JavaScript \\(and thus TypeScript\\) is quite flexible. You can write very OOP code and very FP code, even in the same codebase. In order to successfully [read a lot of code](/workspace/gyGd9$$SJ) you will need to understand both. \n\n"

          "content": "Throughout this course we've had you writing _a lot_ of code, and that's quite intentional. You need to write a lot of code to get good at programming. Repetition of the same concepts, albeit from different angles, is critical to learning programming or anything in life.\n\nThat being said, the following might surprise you:\n\n> Programmers read more code than they write. ++Much more.++\n\nAs a programmer you will _read_ **at least** an order of magnitude more code than you right. Why is this? \n# Collaborative Coding\n\nMost \\(likely **all**\\) software you interact with regularly is written by more than one person. Within a company you work together with other programmers all making contributions to the same codebase. If you can't comfortably read code you're going to be very limited in what you can accomplish. \n\nIn rare circumstances you may be the original creator of some large part of the code or even the whole codebase. In this case other people have to ready **your** code\\. Sounds great, right? Not if you want a productive team. Your coworkers will be adding code constantly, either shrinking the portion of the codebase you're comfortable with or constantly having to argue with you about changes that don't look and feel like your existing code. It's a bad situation and both you and your coworkers will be the worse for it if you don't quickly get comfortable reading other peoples code.\n# Lone Wolf Coding\n\nThis is where the only programmer working on a codebase is you, and even for professional programmers it's quite common. \n\nFor example, on many of my personal projects I'm the only programmer. This means I can do whatever I want. Sounds great, right? Well, in reality... \n\n> Even solo projects have two people working on them: ++You and Future You++ 🤯\n\nThis may sound silly, but I'm 100% serious. Future You will read some of the code you write and think \"What was this person thinking\\!\" before proceeding to rip out a handful of hair. **This will happen**, which is why it's highly desirable to _write_ clean, intelligible, coherent code in the present because Future You will be **reading** it\\.\n# Becoming Literate\n\nWhen you first start out programming reading code other people wrote can be very intimidating. Even reading your own code can be intimidating\\! You might even dread reading code you wrote previously. However, there is hope. \n\nThe pain will pass, and you will get used to it. With enough practice you can read code as well as prose. In fact, with practice you will rarely need to run code in order to know what it does. You can just look at it and you will know, or at least have a good enough idea to use the code.\n\nLiteracy in TypeScript is much like literacy in your native language: it's not an ability you were born with, you had to learn, and learning took time.\n\nThe good news is **programming languages are not nearly as complex as human languages**, so you will learn quickly.\n# If You Can Read You Can Write\n\nReading lots of code will, without a doubt, hands down, 100% make you a better programmer. There's an easy analogy here: If you want to be a better writer of prose it will help if you're also a voracious _reader_ of prose. Being \"well\\-read\" gives you a larger vocabulary, exposure to new and innovative sentence structures as well as giving you a sense of writing style. All the same applies for coding.\n\nAs a reader of code you will both develop your own personal style and learn what it is. You will find other programmers who's code you love and those who's code you can't stand. You will learn to appreciate beautiful architecture that not only works but works consistently without hundreds of `if` statements to handle edge cases.\n# Like Writing, but With Superpowers\n\nThe most important reason to read lots of code though is to learn how to build new things, or build the things you are already building better. For example:\n\n* Do you want to learn how to build a game? You can read through the source code of [Doom for free online](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM) along with [many](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) [other](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake) [open\\-source](https://github.com/simhacker/micropolis) [games](https://github.com/freeciv/freeciv). \n* Do you want to know how operating systems work? The [Linux source code is freely available](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) for you to peruse, download and learn from.\n* What about how to build a [programming language](https://github.com/python/cpython), a [web browser](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/how_to_contribute_firefox.html#clone-the-sources), a [robot](https://github.com/kiloreux/awesome-robotics)?\n\n\nThe projects linked above are all large and intimidating, but that's just to give you an idea of what's possible. \n\nYou can cals find a plethora of code online showing you how to do small, individual tasks. Like [finding the shortest path between two points](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/graph/dijkstra) \\(ever wonder how map apps can give you directions?\\). \n\n> **A word of caution:** Reading a lot of code will not only make you a better programmer, it will also make you a more opinionated programmer. You may start to wonder why your coworkers or other programmers online don't simply build better software. So much sloppy code\\!\n> However, it's important to remember that programming is a team sport. Be empathetic, listen, and above all keep an open mind. Having an open mind is how you will learn enough to have opinions in the first place. Don't lose that openness once you start to feel \"well read.\" \n# Conclusion\n\nRead more code, become a better programmer."

          "content": "There are a few important rules to lay down in the beginning of your journey to become a programmer:\n\n* You don't have to memorize everything.\n* It's okay to forget things.\n* You can always ask Google.\n* StackOverflow, GitHub, MDN, and technical documentation are your new best friends.\n\n---\n# The Detective Methodology\n\nOften times when programming you will find yourself in a situation where you have either forgotten some specific syntax, or, you are using a data structure or build\\-in library method which you have not used before and you know _what_ you want to do but not _how_ to do it exactly. Whenever you reach this state, you are only \\(usually\\) a few well phrased questions away from finding the answers you need.\n\nFor example, imagine you are working with a `Map` and you need to iterate through all the entries in the map but you forget exactly how to do this. Don't panic\\! Simply pause and open Google and search:\n\n> \"How to iterate through all the entries of a map in JavaScript\"\n\nOr any other concise equivalent question.\n\nYou want to formulate a question to ask Google, or your favorite search engine, which includes enough specifics for you to get the relevant answers you are looking for.\n\n* Include the ++language you are using++. Unless your question is specific to TypeScript \\(e.g. related to type definitions, or TypeScript compilation, etc.\\), we recommend using JavaScript to narrow the result selection because there are simply more answers out there for JavaScript questions because JavaScript has existed for around four times as long as TypeScript. And, of course, practically all valid code solutions you find in JavaScript will work in TypeScript.\n* Include ++specific words like method names, data structures, or keywords++ to help find exact, relevant answers.\n\n# Sifting Through the Results\n\nOnce you have some search results, we recommend looking through the top few hits and seeing if anything appears to match your query. Give more credence to the following:\n\n* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): The go\\-to resource for answers to programming questions online.\n* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): Mozilla web and JavaScript official technical reference documentation.\n* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): Another useful and simple to read reference for web technologies.\n* [GitHub/GitHub Issues](https://github.com/): Source code and issues for open source software projects.\n* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) \\(Node Package Manager\\): Once you start installing Node modules \\(you will soon\\), npm will become another invaluable resource you visit frequently.\n\n\nThese are the big ones. As you start to advance to using other technologies, like React, NodeJS, and so on, you may find yourself browsing their documentation or GitHub issues frequently as well. You will very likely find the answer to your question in a post or document on one of the above sites.\n# On Technical Documentation\n\nThe languages, libraries, and technologies you will work with as a developer all provide technical reference material which should be the go\\-to source of truth when you have questions. Think of these like a manual. You should be able to refer to the technical documentation for accurate and up to date answers on:\n\n* How to use library APIs or language/technology features.\n* What are the best practices.\n* What are bad practices/anti\\-patterns.\n* How to upgrade when versions change.\n\n\nIn general, you should always refer to the official technical documentation for a library, package, language, or technology. Learning to \"read the docs\" is a critical skill, especially because there is no standard out there for formatting and displaying documentation\\!\n\n> There is an infamous response to many StackOverflow posts: \"RTFM\".\n> \n> It indicates the original question author should just \"read the docs\" because the question they asked is already answered by the official documentation. 😬\n\nIt's important to treat documentation as the source of truth because documentation _should be updated if the source project changes_. Therefore, it _should_ always be correct. Of course... this is not always true\\! However, the official documentation is more likely to be up to date than some 3rd party answers you may find on other sites or resources, which can easily get out of date.\n\nMany software projects which you will use are new and very popular so they undergo rapid development and many new versions releases with breaking changes\\! Because of this, you should always keep in mind that the answers you find online can become out of date quickly and the best guide is to try to follow the official reference material if you are in doubt.\n# Conclusion\n\nAs you move forward through the course, remember that's it's ok to not know everything\\! The important thing is to understand the fundamental concepts of software engineering and to know when and how to find the specific answers you are looking for online when you need to find them.\n\nTry to become comfortable with this process of searching and reading \\- you will use it often\\!"

You can use GitHub to host your own portfolio of projects.\n* **Terminal:** We will learn how to use a command line to interact directly with your computer and run various commands. This is a critical skill to learn as a developer.\n* **Local Development:** Professional developers tend to build software using IDEs \\(integrated development environments\\), code editors, and terminals on their local computer. It's important to get comfortable using this local development workflow to develop projects and run code.\n* **Deployment/Hosting:** You will need some basic familiarity with deploying your projects and apps. You will learn how to deploy your projects on the internet so you can share your portfolio of projects with the world.\n\n\nWe will also cover some additional topics, such as how developer teams are organized and how they work, how more complex software projects tend to be organized, and how these projects are developed, tested, and deployed.\n\nThe overall purpose of this module is to equip you now, at any early stage, with the tools and workflows you will use as a professional developer to build, manage, and deploy software projects. We believe it's best to start practicing these skills at an early stage so you have plenty of time to build up expertise. Moreover, any employer will expect you to have competence in these areas so it will be a big advantage if you already have a lot of practice with a professional development workflow.\n\n---\n\nAfter this module, we will move into the other major topics of this course which introduce some of the frameworks and libraries for building client and server applications, which will fully equip you to build and ship fullstack apps for your products ideas. These modules will build upon the skills you learn in this module: you will build and deploy the projects for those modules independently using the skills and tools you learn here."

When you hear about \"open source\" software usually what people are actually referring to is software on GitHub. It's not the only place where you can find open source software but it's the most widely used.\n\n## Git\n\nGitHub gets its name from a tool called Git, which we'll get into in this module. Git is a tool for managing changes to text files. We have a whole section dedicated to Git later in this module.\n# What is GitHub for?\n\n* Backing up your code\n* Collaborating on code with others\n* Finding open source software\n\n\n## Backup\n\nWhen you write software you will want to back it up somewhere. Imagine you spend two weeks creating a new app and your computer dies. If you don't have a backup there's not much you can do.\n\nYou don't need GitHub to backup code of course—any USB drive or external hard\\-drive will do just fine. However, GitHub adds additional tools that make storing your software easier and more helpful. \n\n## Collaborating\n\nGit and GitHub let software engineers work together on code.\n\n> \n> #### How do software engineers collaborate?\n> \n> Have you ever thought about this question? Code is just text on a computer, but what if you and I want to work together on a project? We can't both use the same computer at the same time. Maybe we can both make changes to the code on our computers and then share the code when we're done. However, what if we both make changes to the same file... how do we decide which changes to keep and which to discard?\n> \n> Git and GitHub hold the answers to these questions.\n\n\n## Open Source Software\n\nThere's lots of software in the world that you can use for free and _a lot_ of it is hosted on Github. In this course we'll often point to GitHub as the location for some piece of third\\-party software.\n\nThe real benefit of open source software is that you don't have to write everything yourself. You can use other people's code that they've shared to solve problems in your own apps. You also get access to world class source code that you can read to help learn."

The \"path\" is a way of describing a location on a computer's hard drive.\n\nFor example, the application Terminal.app on Mac computers is located at `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`. This is an example of a path. It's an exact representation of a location on the hard drive.\n\n## Special Symbols and Variables\n\nWhen using paths there are special values that have a specific meaning. There are also variables you can use. Here are the most common:\n\n* `.` \\(a period character\\): The current directory. \n   * Example: `cd ./app` \\(Putting `.` and `/` together like this means \"The `app` directory relative to my current directory\\).\n* `..` \\(two period characters\\): The parent directory. \n   * Example `cd ..`.\n* `~` \\(a tilde character\\): Your home directory. We cover this more in the video. \n   * Example: `cd ~`.\n* `$HOME`: Also means the home directory. This is a variable. \n   * Example: `cd $HOME`.\n\n\nIf you're uncertain where a file is located but you can find it in Finder or File Explorer then you can drag the file into your terminal."

For now, just check out how we use redirection and know that it exists.\n# Example\n\n```bash\n# Download example.com into a HTML file\ncurl 'http://example.com' > example.html\n\n# Concatenate two files into one (this is where\n# \"cat\" gets its name)\ncat a.txt b.txt > ab.txt\n\n# Append \"Hello Pairwise\" to the end of a file\necho \"Hello Pairwise\" >> file.txt\n\n```\n# Redirection\n\nIn a shell, the output of any command can be put into a file. This is done using the `>` character\\. If you already have a file and you want to _append_ the output of your command to it you can use `>>` instead\\.\n\n* `>` Will put your output into a file, writing over it if it already exists.\n* `>>` Will append your output to a file, preserving whatever content was there before.\n\n# curl\n\nIn this lesson we also introduce the `curl` command, which can be used to download files on the command line.\n\nMore generally, `curl` can be used to make any HTTP request. Although it may not be obvious yet, `curl` will be very handy later on. It's useful for testing your own APIs or using external APIs from the command line.\n\n## curl Examples\n\n```bash\n# Send a GET request to http://example.com\n# and show the response on screen\ncurl 'http://example.com'\n\n# Same as above but also display request info and \n# all headers. -v stands for \"verbose.\" This is \n# useful for learning about HTTP and debugging.\ncurl -v 'http://example.com'\n\n# Store the results of a request in a file. \n# In other words, download the URL into a file.\ncurl 'http://example.com' > response.html\n\n# Send a POST request along with some data to the server.\ncurl -X POST -d '{ \"name\": \"Cat\" }' 'http://example.com'\n\n```\n"

Why does this matter? \n# Why Node.js is a big deal\n\nNode\\.js is important because it allows JavaScript to transcend browsers. In the past, if you wanted to run JavaScript you needed a web browser. Nothing wrong with this in theory—everyone has a web browser and browsers are all free to download if you somehow don't have one. The problem is that browsers are limited. Using a browser you cannot access the filesystem, you cannot create an HTTP server, you can't interact with the operating system. \n\n> NOTE: **This is a good thing.**\n> If it was possible for any website to access your computer you would be getting hacked ALL THE TIME. Thankfully that's not the case.\n\nNode\\.js did two very important things:\n\n* It allowed JS to run outside the browser.\n* It allowed JS to interact with the operating system.\n   * This means working with files, creating servers, etc.\n\n# Node\\.js and TypeScript\n\nSo, Node lets you run JavaScript. How does that relate to TypeScript? \n\nSince TypeScript can be compiled to JavaScript, Node implicitly lets you run TypeScript as well.\n\nIt works like this:\n\n* Write some TS code\n* Compile it to JS with `tsc`\n* Run it with `node`\n\n\nAnywhere JavaScript can go, TypeScript can also go. This means that since JavaScript can also be used for desktop and mobile apps, TypeScript can too. "

          "content": "In all the previous challenges we kept our code to a single file. This is simple, but not always practical. Most apps will be at least a few thousand lines of code and there's no limit to how large a codebase can get. \n\nAs your codebase grows you will want to start organizing it into separate files. TypeScript is happy to let us do this, but we need to learn some new syntax.\n# Import and Export\n\nWhen working on a TypeScript file you can `import` code from other files and `export` code for other files to use. Let's consider an example. We have two files, `app.ts` and `math.ts`. Both files are in the same directory.\n\n### app\\.ts\n\n```typescript\nimport { add, subtract } from \"./math\";\n\nconsole.log(`1 + 1 is ${add(1, 1)}`); // 1 + 1 is 2\nconsole.log(`1 - 1 is ${subtract(1, 1)}`); // 1 - 1 is 0\n\n```\n\n### math\\.ts\n\n```typescript\nexport const add = (a: number, b: number) => {\n  return a + b;\n};\n\nexport const subtract = (a: number, b: number) => {\n  return a - b;\n};\n\n```\n\n`app.ts` is able to `import` the two functions exported from `math.ts` using the special syntax for importing.\n# Syntax\n\nLet's describe the import and export syntax formally.\n\n## Import\n\nTo import from another file use:\n\n1. The `import` keyword followed by a space.\n1. The `{` character followed by the names of exports from the target file separated by commas and a closing `}` character\\. In our example this was `{ add, subtract }`.\n1. The `from` keyword\\.\n1. A string representing the path to another TS file _without_ the `.ts` file extension.In our example this was `./math`.\n\n\n## Export\n\nTo export from a file use:\n\n1. The `export` keyword placed in front of any top\\-level values in your file.\n\n\nSome more examples are in order:\n\n```typescript\n// Export a number\nexport const WIDTH = 1200;\n\n// Export a boolean\nexport const bool = true;\n\n// Export a string\nexport const name = \"Pairwise\";\n\n// Export arrays and objects\nexport const cats = [\n  { name: \"Maomi\", job: \"Sleeping\" },\n  { name: \"Larper\", job: \"Roleplay\" },  \n];\n\n// Export a function\nexport const toUpper = (s: string) => {\n  return s.toUpperCase();\n};\n\n```\n\nUsually you can just add the `export` keyword before existing values in your files in order to export them.\n# Special Cases\n\nNow we've explored the most common import/export usage let's look at some other patterns you'll find in the wild.\n\n## Default Imports and Exports\n\nIt is possible to define a \"default\" value to be exported from a file. Let's look at the syntax. Imagine we wanted to put each of our math functions into their own file. We could do the following:\n\n### add\\.ts\n\n```typescript\nconst add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;\nexport default add;\n\n```\n\n### subtract\\.ts\n\n```typescript\nconst subtract = (a: number, b: number) => a - b;\nexport default subtract;\n\n```\n\nWe use the special `export default` syntax rather than simply the `export` keyword\\. This allows the importing file to avoid using bracket syntax:\n\n### app\\.ts\n\n```typescript\nimport add from \"./add\";\nimport subtract from \"./subtract\";\n\nconsole.log(`1 + 1 is ${add(1, 1)}`); // 1 + 1 is 2\nconsole.log(`1 - 1 is ${subtract(1, 1)}`); // 1 - 1 is 0\n\n```\n\nNotice that the file does exactly the same thing as `app.ts` from the beginning of this lesson, but the syntax for importing is slightly different.\n\n## index\\.ts\n\nAnother special case you will encounter is the special file `index.ts`. This file is special because you can import from it in a slightly different way than other files.\n\nAs another example, let's say you have a `./lib` directory in your project and within that directory you have an `index.ts` file\\. It's contents will be the same as our `math.ts` file from above.\n\n### index\\.ts\n\n```typescript\nexport const add = (a: number, b: number) => {\n  return a + b;\n};\n\nexport const subtract = (a: number, b: number) => {\n  return a - b;\n};\n\n```\n\nNow, if we want to import these functions rather than importing form `./lib/index` we would actually just import from `./lib`.\n\n### app\\.ts\n\n```typescript\nimport { add, subtract } from \"./lib\";\n\nconsole.log(`1 + 1 is ${add(1, 1)}`); // 1 + 1 is 2\nconsole.log(`1 - 1 is ${subtract(1, 1)}`); // 1 - 1 is 0\n\n```\n\nWhy? The filename `index.ts` is special. When you import from a **directory** rather than an individual file TypeScript will check for an `index.ts` file within that directory. If it finds it, that file will be used as the import."

In other words you can use external modules that you created.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe benefit of using external modules is that you gain access to an entire world of code that's already written and often well\\-tested. This means you can be way, **WAY** more productive than if you had to write everything yourself.\n# How to use external modules\n\nFirst, install something you want to use. In the video here we use the module [got,](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) which is a TypeScript module that will let you make requests, similar to using `curl` from the command line.\n\nOn the command line install the module:\n```\nnpm install got\n\n```\n\nIn your TypeScript file import the module:\n```typescript\nimport got from \"got\";\n\n```\n\nNote that importing an external file will use a path, such as `./path/to/file` while importing a module will simply be the module name, such as `got`.\n\nAside from the modules we will recommend throughout this course, you can search for modules in multiple ways:\n\n* Using Google. This may be obvious, but Google \\(or any search engine\\) can be helpful in finding modules.\n* [NPMS\\.io.](https://npms.io/) NPMS tries to be an actual search engine for modules, creating their own relevance criteria and trying to show modules relevant to keywords. It's not perfect, but it helps.\n   * Both Yarn and NPM have module \"search\" features but they aren't very useful. As of this writing you can't use them for keyword search, only name search. So if you don't know the name of what you're looking for you probably won't find it. This largely defeats the purpose of searching.\n* Other people's code. When you read the source code of external modules they will almost always import even more modules. This way you can often find modules that might be hard to discover otherwise.\n\n"

You've probably never used this word much in the past but you're going to be hearing it a lot from here on out. Today we're talking about creating your first Git repo, which is short for repository.\n\nAs you're learning programming and specifically `git` you will be creating quite a few repos. Here's what the workflow usually looks like. \n\nOn the command line:\n```bash\nmkdir my-new-project\ncd my-new-project\n\n# Here we go...\ngit init\n\n# Now let's add a file\necho \"My new project\" > readme.md\n\n# \"Stage\" all the files using `.`\ngit add .\n\n# Now \"commit\" your first code\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n\n```\n# Staging\n\nGit uses the idea of a multi\\-stage process to write your code. \n\nFirst, you simply write the code. At this stage your code is either \"untracked\" or \"modified.\" \n\nOnce you've made some discrete progress on your code you \"stage\" it by using `git add`. The reason for this middle stage is so that you can mark things as done while still working on other files that will be part of the same commit.\n\nFinally you \"commit\" your code by attaching a message to it. At first, this may seem like a lot of extra work just to change a few things, and you're not wrong. It is indeed more work to use git that simply to edit files and hit save. However, the benefits of using git are so significant that you will be very happy git exists once you understand it and how to use it.\n\nTo reiterate, the three stages are:\n\n* Write code\n* Stage code\n* Commit code\n\n# Committing\n\nIn practice, you will usually stage and commit at the same time. It's very common to write some code and immediately stage and the commit it.\n\nTherefor lets focus on committing. \n\n## The idea\n\nWhen you change code you want to organize your changes. For example, if I'm working on the Pairwise website and I want make all the text larger I can simply edit one file, stage it and commit it. One and done.\n\nMy commit message might be:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Increase default font size\"\n\n```\n\nHowever, what if I want to change the way we render code on mobile? It's possible that making this change can be done in only one file, but I may need to edit multiple files. This type of situation is very common. \n\nIn this case I would modify all the files one by one and sometimes flipping back and fourth between them. When everything was complete I would stage and commit. Similar to the font size change, I will just have one commit with a short message:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Improve mobile rendering performance\"\n\n```\n\n\n### One \"change\" one commit\n\nThis is the core idea here. Every time you change something in the general sense you write a commit message. You do **not** write a commit message every time you change a file, only every time you've completed a discrete chunk of work to accomplish some goal.\n\n### Why?\n\nA few reasons:\n\n* If you wrote a commit message every time you changed a file it would become very, very tedious. In fact you would either stop committing altogether or write meaningless commit messages like `Update stuff...`.\n* When you \\(or your teammates\\) decide to look back at some changes they can already see all the specific changes in a file. Git tracks all your changes, so if you were writing commit messages for every small change you would be adding meaningless information \\(aka noise\\).\n\n\nThe point of a commit message is to give a broader summary of what changed, something you cannot get simply by looking at the changes in git. Imagine your friend asks you \"What will these changes do?\" You might respond \"They will ... `improve mobile rendering performance`\" or \"These changes will `increase the default font size`.\" See the pattern? \n\nCommit messages should complete the statement  \"These changes will... \"\n# Logging\n\nDid I mention yet that git will track your changes?? Yes? OK, good. Then you've probably guessed that git will also show you changes it tracked in the past. `git log` is the command that lets us do that.\n\nThe basic command is very simple: `git log`. \n\nUsing this command you will be able to see all your history so far. If you just created the repository there won't be much there, but you can see much more if you clone a repository from Github.\n\n`git log` also has many different flags \\(aka options\\) you can pass to change the output. Here's a more advanced example:\n\n```bash\ngit log --color --graph --abbrev-commit\n\n```\n\nOr how about this one?\n\n```bash\ngit log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit\n\n```\n\nDon't worry about remembering any of these. You can experiment with what log format works best for you and then create an alias for it in your `.bashrc` file\\. For example, mine has that long command above aliases to `glog`, so whenever I'm in a repository I can just type `glog` and use that long command.\n\n# TODO\n\n Also show that git is so universal as to be built into vscode.\nAlso maybe set their `$EDITOR` var to vscode."

          "content": "We've created this section to give you the bare minimum you need to be effective with Git. Why? Two reasons:\n\n* It's simply such a large tool that an entire course could be dedicated to it.\n* It would get boring.\n\n\nThat second point is key—it would get boring\\! Meaning ++it would not be useful++. In fact, it might be counterproductive. \n\nIf we try to teach you everything many of you, our students, will simply stop learning. This may not be you specifically but many will. We've seen it happen. It happened to me\\! That's not an interesting story though so I'll omit it. \n\nWhat's relevant is that it's your job with our help to strike a balance between learning everything and staying interested.\n\n> Aside: To all the skeptics thinking \"There's already been a lot of boring stuff in this course,\" the difference is some things are absolutely necessary. On the other hand, some things can be skipped over completely and you can learn them on the job when you need them.\n# Just a Tool\n\nRemember, Git is not useful on its own. It's useful as a tool to manage a codebase. So learn as much as you need to get started and learn more as you need it.\n# Advanced Git\n\nAlright, let's look at some more advanced Git uses.\n\n## git rebase\n\nThis is similar to `git merge` in that it combines two commit histories into one, however it will do so without a merge commit. This means your git history will be much more linear. This is useful when your changes logically are linear. \n\nFor example, when two developers work on completely separate features we can pretend they worked in sequence. Developer A pushes some commits, then Developer B pushes more commits on top of that. In practice they were working at the same time, but we can use `git rebase` to make our git history linear.\n\n## git bisect\n\n`bisect` tells git to help you search for a bug on your code. The gist is this:\n\n* Identify how to reproduce a bug in your code\n* Run git bisect\n\n\nNow the following will happen until the bug is found:\n\n* Git will run `checkout` on a past branch\n* Tell git whether or not the bug exists\n   * If a bug exists, git will check out a branch further in the past\n   * If the bug does not exist, git will check out a branch further in the future\n* The process will repeat\n\n\nWhat this does is automatically isolates the commit that introduced the bug. This is useful because you can look at the diff of that commit and greatly limit the code you have to look at. It's an extremely useful command, with a slight drawback:\n\n> `git bisect` relies on a meaningful git history to work.\n\nWhat this means is if you have a single commit with 5000 lines of changes, and that commit introduces a bug, `git bisect` doesn't help that much—5000 lines is still a lot to look through. The way to avoid this and produce a meaningful commit history is to bias towards smaller commits more often. \n\n## git reset\n\n`git reset` will revert changes. It's considered \"advanced\" simply because it can actually delete things and you won't be able to get them back. \n\nIf you delete a file or some code using your editor, git will keep track of those deletions. However, if you use `git reset --hard` you are telling git to revert changes _and_ completely discard them. This is a useful command, just like `rm` is a useful command, but if you're not careful you may end up deleting more than you want.\n# Ask Your Coworkers\n\nIf you end up working in a company, chances are there's at least one person \\(maybe only one person\\) who is an absolute Git Wizard™. These people are very valuable resources because you can ask them obscure questions that are hard to search for online.\n\nAs with everything we're teaching you, never be afraid to ask for help or look ignorant. Acknowledging you don't know is the first step towards knowing. \n\nMost likely you don't have coworkers you can ask yet, but this course teaches you everything you need to know to get a job.\n# More Git Resources\n\n* [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) — A free online Git tutorial with visualizations.

Things like VSCode, Firefox and Excel are all examples.\n\nYou can _also_ install software on the command line.

You use a package manager to install other software. A \"package\" is just another word for software.\n\n\n## apt: Windows and Linux\n\nOn Linux we have `apt`, which you will also have on Windows if you set up your system as we described earlier in this module \\(here's a [link](/workspace/RCm1HkcbQ) if you missed it\\). Linux already has a package manger installed and it's called `apt`.\n\n### Examples\n\nIn the examples below I'll use `<package>` to denote any package you might want to install. When you want a specific package be sure to replace `<package>` with the specific thing you want to install.\n\n```bash\n# Install a specific package\napt install <package>\n\n# List all the currently installed packages\napt list --installed\n\n# Show information for a specific package\napt show <package>\n\n# Search for a package\napt search <package>\n\n```\n\n## brew: Mac\n\nOn a Mac, things are not so simple. We have to install a third\\-party package manager called Homebrew. The latest instructions to install Homebrew can be found on their site: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)\n\nAs of this writing the installation command is:\n\n```\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n\n```\n\nHomebrew uses a command called `brew`. Once you have `brew` installed you can start using it much like `apt`.\n\n### Examples\n\nIn the examples below I'll use `<package>` to denote any package you might want to install.

          "content": "Asynchronous or \"async\" programming introduces the concept of _time_ into a computer program. Computer executes programs sequentially, line by line, in the exact order they were written. However, sometimes an operation has to make a request to some other software program, or another computer, and it must wait for the \"next instruction\" before it can continue.\n\nFor instance, perhaps a user submits an order to buy a product online. The order must be sent to a server and processed. It could fail\\! The client application \\(a webpage, a mobile app, etc.\\) must _wait for the response_ from the request before it can proceed. Depending on the response, the program may take different actions.\n\nThis is what \"async\" programming refers to. More generally, it refers to the concept in programming of allowing units of work to be separated and run in parallel. The e\\-commerce app in the above example could still function and perform other tasks if necessary while waiting for the transaction to succeed or fail.\n\nHere's an example of a simple asynchronous program in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\n// Define an interface for products\ninterface Product {\n    id: string;\n    amount: number;\n}\n\n// Submit a transaction to buy a product\nconst submitTransaction = async (product: Product) => {\n    try {\n        // Send request to the server API\n        const result = await API.sendBuyRequestToServer(product);\n        return result;\n    } catch (err) {\n        return \"Request failed!\";\n    }\n};\n\n// Create a product\nconst pairwise: Product = {\n    id: \"sad98f7\",\n    amount: 5.00,\n}\n\n// Submit a purchase request for the product\nconst purchaseResult = submitTransaction(pairwise);\n\n// See the result\nconsole.log(purchaseResult);\n\n```\n\nTry to read through the code, but don't worry if you don't understand all of it\\!\n\nThe last thing to mention in this introduction is the idea of an _API\\._ This stands for \"Application Programming Interface\" and it's a big phrase to refer to something simple: the rules for talking to a program from the outside.\n\nProgramming languages define strict rules for how to communicate instructions to computers. Computer programs must also define strict rules if other computer programs can interact with them. That's all an API is. An API defines the rules for how you can make requests to another program.\n\nFor example, in our hypothetical e\\-commerce store above, the server presents some API which allows you to purchase a product. This API requires a `Product` with an `id` and `amount`, and in the example is represented by the function `API.sendBuyRequestToServer`. In a real program, this function would make a network request to a server. Some seconds would pass while this is happening, before the result comes back and the program continues executing.\n\nYou will find that APIs and asynchronous programming are indispensable for building modern software applications. Apps simply just have to talk to other apps to get data and perform actions\\! This module is all about teaching you how to write asynchronous code and interact with APIs. Let's get started\\!"

Timers are a great way to learn about async programming because they allow you to build programs which use delays, or timeouts, or intervals, to cause actions to occur in the future.\n\nLater, we will explore more advanced topics like promises, callbacks, async/await, APIs, network requests, and error handling. But to start out we are going to look at timers because these are a nice way to introduce the concept of asynchronous program execution.\n\nConsider this code for instance:\n\n```\n// Log starting message\nconsole.log(\"Starting the program...\");\n\n// Run a function after a 1 second delay\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  // Watch the console output carefully when running the code!\n  console.log(\"You will see me after a 1 second delay!\");\n}, 1000);\n\n// Log finishing message\nconsole.log(\"Finishing the program...\");\n\n```\n\nThis will result in the following console output:\n\n```\n\"Starting the program...\"\n\"Finishing the program...\"\n// After a 1 second delay:\n\"You will see me after a 1 second delay!\"\n\n```\n\nThe `setTimeout` keyword sets a timer which runs the callback function after a delay. So this code basically gets scheduled and executed in the future, rather then immediately. The result is the log messages come in a different order than they are written in the actual program.\n\nHopefully this example is clear to understand\\! Generally, it can be hard to wrap your head around asynchronous program execution, but async programming is one of the core building blocks to build up more complex applications."

          "content": "Now that we've gotten the basics of asynchronous programming with a few challenges using timers, we're going to dive straight into the modern language syntax which allows us to write asynchronous functions: async/await. The async/await syntax is a newer language feature which allows us to very easily work with asynchronous code.\n\nWith async/await, you can write asynchronous code which \"appears\" synchronous. The result is it is much easier to write and reason about the execution of the code and the possible results.\n\nFor instance, consider this code snippet:\n\n```\nconst handleFetchUser = async () => {\n    try {\n        // This next line executes asynchronously\n        const user = await fetchUserAsync();\n        console.log(\"Got user: \", user);\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.log(\"Error fetching the user \", err);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe only new elements here are the `async` and `await` keywords\\. The rest should be familiar to you. The only different here is that the `fetchUserAsync` function \\(not defined\\) is an _asynchronous_ function which makes some request and returns a result sometime later in the future. You don't know _when_ that will happen. And, the request could fail\\! If it fails, you also don't know _when _that will happen.\n\nHowever, with the async/await syntax you can write the above code _as if_ it is actually synchronously. That is to say, by using the `await` keyword, the program will wait for the result from the `fetchUserAsync` function and once it gets the result that will be stored in the `user` variable\\. Alternatively, if it fails and throws and error you can catch this error with a normal `try/catch` construction\\.\n\nThis might seem very straightforward... and it is\\! Just wait until you see how asynchronous code was written before the async/await syntax was built into the language.\n\nSo, moving forward we will cover the async/await syntax in this section and get some practice writing asynchronous functions. Later, we will cover other language features and patterns related to handling asynchronous code: promises and callbacks."

Promises can exist in one of three states:\n\n1. **Pending state:** waiting for eventual completion of the future value.\n1. **Fulfilled/Resolved state:** the operation the promise was waiting on his completed successfully.\n1. **Rejected/Failed state:** the operation the promise was waiting on failed.\n\n\nYou can create a promise using the `Promise` constructor:\n\n```\n// The \"...\" are required arguments\nconst myPromise = new Promise(...);\n\n```\n\nThe `Promise` constructor accepts a callback function as an argument. This callback function will be used when the promise reaches its completion or failed state in the future. We have seen callback functions in earlier lessons, but here we will introduce them more explicitly. A \"callback\" or callback function is a function you provide in different scenarios which is then executed by other code. For instance, we have seen callbacks in the context of `map` `filter` and `reduce`:\n\n```typescript\nconst names = [\"Sam\", \"Joe\", \"Ben\"];\n\nconst upperCaseNames = names.map((name: string) => {\n    return name.toUpperCase();\n});\n\n```\n\nThe function supplied to `.map` is a \"callback\" function. The `.map` implementation will call this function for every item in the `names` array\\. Callback functions have a wide variety of uses, but they are especially important when working with asynchronous code.\n\nIn the case of promises, you supply a callback function to the `Promise` constructor which is used to handle the completion or failure of the promise. For instance:\n\n```\nconst promiseCallback = (resolve, reject) => {\n    resolve(\"Promise resolved!\");\n}\n\nconst myPromise = new Promise(promiseCallback);\n\n```\n\nThe `promiseCallback` is the callback function which is supplied to the `Promise` constructor\\. This callback function accepts two arguments, which are also functions\\! These are typically named `resolve` and `reject`. These functions are used to handle the completion states of the promise.\n\nCalling the `resolve` method and passing in a value will cause the promise to fulfill and resolve to whatever value is passed in to the `resolve` function\\. Conversely, calling the `reject` function will cause the promise to reject \\(throw an error\\) and the error will contain whatever argument is passed to the `reject` function\\.\n\nThis may feel a little confusing \\- don't worry\\! We will get plenty of practice working with promises directly in the next few challenges\\! Promises inherently involve \"waiting\" for operations to complete in the future, and the syntax is a little more challenging to understand. That's why we are introducing promises now, after we have already discussed async/await.\n\nFundamentally, async/await allows you to write functions which handle promise\\-like values. Whenever you `await` a value, beneath the surface you are awaiting the result of a promise fulfilling or rejecting. This should give you a good frame of reference to dig in deeper and understand promises more directly.\n\nLet's get started\\!"

          "content": "# Intro\n\nNow that you have learned a lot of the basics of working with asynchronous code we'll get into more of the useful things you can start to use these skills with. This starts with making network requests using the hypertext transfer protocol \\(HTTP\\). You are probably familiar with HTTP, or it's more secure counterpart HTTPS, having seen it in many web URLs, e.g. `https://app.pairwise.tech`.\n\nWhen you type in a web URL like this in a web browser and hit enter, the web browser is using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to fetch the resource stored at that url. The web browser makes a network request and the protocol resolves the request and return a response, which is usually an HTML document for that URL. The HTML document often will contain links to other resources, like CSS and JS files which will then be downloaded. These together constitute a website and this entire process occurs asynchronously using networking and HTTP.\n# Client Server Model\n\nHTTP follows the client server model, which is to say that communication requests are always initiated by a client \\(think: user, like you or me\\). Then, that request is propagated across a network \\(in our case, the web/internet\\) and eventually reaches some destination server, which is another computer running a server application which can handle processing the request and issuing a response.\n\nThe important points to understand here are the idea that the client always initiates the communication, the communication is asynchronous by nature, and the server handles processing the request and responding to clients.\n\nA typical interaction could be loading a webpage which then makes a `GET` request using HTTP to a server to fetch a user, using the path `/user`. The server then receives this request, checks the authentication state of the request, retrieves the associated user profile from a database, and then returns a response to the request containing the user information. Then, the webpage does something with this user information. The code which initiated the original `GET` request then receives this response data, and the roundtrip made possible by HTTP is complete.\n# Network Requests and HTTP\n\nThese network based communications are ubiquitous in our world. They are made in the dozens by all the machines in our lives: smart phones, smart watches, tablets, desktops, laptops. These requests are made possible because of HTTP, which is a protocol for transmitting documents across the web. There is a huge amount of information you could dig into regarding internet protocols but here we will focus on the application layer HTTP protocol which allows you to send network requests.\n\n> We highly recommend browsing through the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) on the HTTP protocol. It covers some of the important details really well, and it's useful to have some more in depth knowledge on this important topic.\n\nPractically, as a developer, you will use HTTP all the time to make requests to servers.\n# HTTP Components\n\nHTTP is a standardized protocol in which requests contain specific components which are used to define what actions should occur. The main components of an _HTTP request_ are:\n\n* The **HTTP method**, which is usually a verb which signifies the \"type\" of request. The most common HTTP methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.\n* The **resource path**, such as `/user` or `/api`. This is basically like a url path, and it allows a server application to map an HTTP request to a specific handler \\(think: function\\) which is responsible for processing the request and issuing a response.\n* The **HTTP version,** which is just the version of the HTTP protocol the client is using. HTTP, like almost all software, is versioned.\n* **Request headers,**\\_ \\_which are optional but can contain some additional metadata, content, or instructions relevant to the request or response. For example, you may send authentication or caching parameters in HTTP headers.\n* A **request body**, which is optional but can include some payload of data sent to a server.\n\n\n_HTTP responses_ also contain several common components \\(and also including the HTTP version and response headers\\):\n\n* **Status code**: a numeric code representing the request status. See a [full list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n* **Status message:** a short description of the status code.\n* An optional **response body**, which contains the data or content relevant to the response.\n\n# AJAX\n\nAn important point \\(partially historical\\) to note here is the notion of [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started): Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Historically, web requests were made by a browser which would load a web page by fetching resources and that was it\\! Any further interactions would generally require a new web resource to be fetched and the page would need to go through a full reload to show any updates or changes. Imagine that as a user\\!\n\nThis was a big disadvantage in the early days of the internet, and gradually technologies were developed to improve this experience. That's where AJAX comes in, which started to appear in Google applications \\(Gmail and Google Maps\\) in 2004 and 2005 and then become solidified by the W3C as a web standard in 2006.\n\nWith AJAX, you can write JavaScript code which can make a network request using HTTP and receive response data and update an HTML webpage dynamically without having to reload the page. This was a major improvement and opened the doors to the great proliferation of web applications and technologies we have seen over the past 1\\-2 decades.\n# This Section\n\nIn this section, we will get our hands dirty making some HTTP requests and handling HTTP responses. We \\(the client\\) will use TypeScript \\(JavaScript\\) to initiate HTTP requests using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to a Pairwise server. We will get to apply our asynchronous programming skills we learned in the past few challenges and learn about how to use HTTP to make network requests\\!\n\nAs mentioned, we will be interacting with a server. Cool\\! We have created and deployed a simple server for this purpose. The [repo is public and you can find it here](https://github.com/pairwise-tech/pairwise-example-http-api). We encourage you to take a look\\! We will cover this in more detail in the Backend Programming module, but this serves as a nice preview of what's to come.\n\nJust for the sake of understanding, the repo contains a server application which is just a TypeScript program. What it does, when run, is start a server listening on a port. What's a server? It's just an application which is setup to process network requests via HTTP\\! Our server exposes a few different endpoints, or \"APIs\", which we can interact with here, using HTTP.\n\nOk, with all of that out of the way, let's dive in\\!"

          "content": "You may have seen the term \"JSON\" before, or it may be new to you\\! We need to introduce it here. JSON is short for \"JavaScript Object Notation\" and it is basically a way to _serialize \\_and \\_deserialize_ data\\. What does this mean?\n\nComputers need a way to \"package\" up data to transmit it. Think of it like sending a letter to a friend. You don't just put the letter in the mail, you need to \"package\" it in an envelope to send. Ok... it's not the best analogy in the history of the world, but the main point is that data needs to be transformed to another format before it is sent in a request to a server.\n\nJSON is a universally used data format for this purpose. JSON is a data format which is \"like\" JavaScript objects, hence the name. And, in JavaScript/TypeScript, you have a global utility object called `JSON` which we can use to convert objects to JSON and convert JSON back to regular objects.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n```typescript\nconst data = {\n  list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  isTrue: true,\n  isFalse: false,\n  isNull: null,\n  myObject: {\n    name: \"Sam\",\n    level: 100,\n  },\n};\n\n```\n\nThis is just a simple object containing some data. What is the JSON representation of this object? We can get it by using the `JSON.stringify` function:\n\n```\nconst json = JSON.stringify(data);\n\n// json:\n// \"{\"list\":[1,2,3,4,5],\"isTrue\":true,\"isFalse\":false,\"isNull\":null,\"myObject\":{\"name\":\"Sam\",\"level\":100}}\"\n\n```\n\nYou can see the result is a simple string of text, which does resemble the original object. This makes JSON ideal as a data transmission format. It is language agnostic but follows some simple conventions for serializing and deserializing data. How could we deserialize this JSON data? With the `JSON.parse` method:\n\n```\n// The data variable will contained the original parsed data object again:\nconst data = JSON.parse(json);\n\n```\n\nWhy is JSON important?\n\nJSON is the canonical way to send data between clients and servers. It is language agnostic so it doesn't matter if your server is written in TypeScript, Python, Go, or Java, or if your client is a JavaScript web app or an iOS mobile app written in Swift \\- all of these can use JSON as a data transmission format for sending data back and forth.\n\nIn a moment, we will use the `PUT` and `POST` HTTP methods to send data to a server. As you may expect, we will need to convert our data to JSON before sending it\\!\n\nIn the next lesson, we will get some practicing serializing and deserializing data. If you're interested, we recommend taking a quick look at the [MDN JSON reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), which provides a more detailed picture."

The second argument is the optional [RequestInit](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-JavaScript/interfaces/_node_modules_typedoc_node_modules_typescript_lib_lib_dom_d_.requestinit.html) argument, which supplies additional parameters to the fetch method, such as the HTTP method type, headers, caching policy, and so on.\n\nTo `POST` data, we need to specify fetch to use the `POST` method\\. Then, we need to add a `Content-Type` header to indicate we are sending JSON data, and finally we need to supply the data we want to POST as the `body` property\\. An example might look like this:\n\n```\nfetch(\"my-api/\", {\n    // Set the HTTP method for the request\n    method: \"post\",\n    // Include headers to specify the content type\n    headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    },\n    // data is some data you want to POST (converted to JSON!):\n    body: JSON.stringify({ data }),\n});\n\n```\n\nThe response we get as a result will include a `json` method we can call to convert the response body from JSON to an object we can view directly.\n\nIn the editor below, finish the implementation of the `postRequest` method to make a `POST` request to our sample API. Then, return the response data using the `.json` method\\. Good luck\\!",

What does this mean?\n\nIdempotence is an important concept to understand. An _idempotent_ operation is one in which you should get the same outcome regardless of how many times the operation is applied.\n\nConsider updating a user's name in a database. This operation should be idempotent because the result should always be the same regardless of if you make the request 1 time or 1,000 times. However, consider placing an order in an e\\-commerce store. This operation is probably not idempotent, because each successive request places an additional order for the customer.\n\nThis is the general distinction between `PUT` and `POST` requests\\. You should be aware, however, that enforcing idempotence is not guaranteed simply by using a `PUT` request \\- it depends largely on the backend server implementation handling the request and the type of operation.\n\nSo, this is a more of a semantic distinction within HTTP where a `PUT` request has the added meaning/context that the operation _should_ be idempotent.\n\nAside from this distinction, a `PUT` request is otherwise very similar to a `POST` request\\.

There also exists a `PATCH` method and a [few others](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) as well. What's with all of these different methods and when should you use one or the other?\n\nEach of these methods do have a general semantic meaning which should reflect the underlying operation:\n\n```none\nGET: Fetch a resource\nPOST: Create a new resource\nPUT: Replace (fully update a resource)\nPATCH: Update a resource\nDELETE: Delete a resource\n\n```\n\nIn an ideal scenario, the HTTP method you use should reflect the type of operation which is occurring, more or less according to the above guidelines. However, there are two big problems with this:\n\n1. Simply using a specific method does not enforce anything regarding the operation which occurs. When you send an HTTP `GET` request to a server, the server decides what happens when it handles that request. There's nothing to stop a backend developer programming a `GET` request handler to _delete_ some resource. That would be a total violation of HTTP\\! However, nothing in HTTP prevents deviations like this from happening. Moreover, deleting a resource when handling a `GET` request is a pretty dramatic example, but it's very common for servers to use `POST` requests for creating, updating, and even deleting resources. Again, this does not strictly follow HTTP, but you will find this in practice when working with servers and making HTTP requests.\n1. If you are a client consuming some external API you don't control, you have no choice but to adhere to whatever HTTP methods that API enforces \\(more on APIs later \\- for now just think of it as these HTTP handlers which exist on servers\\). If a server has an HTTP API exposed to update a record using a `POST` request, if you want to update that record you have no choice but to send a `POST` request \\- no matter that `POST` should be used for creating resources and `PUT` or `PATCH` for updating.\n\n\nThe takeaway here is that in practice you will find that the actual servers and APIs you interact with may not have a consistent usage of the HTTP methods we have seen so far. We also did not cover all the HTTP methods which are available in these challenges \\- but we did cover the most common: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.\n\nIt's useful to be aware of the others, and understand that each has a specific intended meaning, but also remember that you may find many deviations from the rules in practice."

You will need to supply a token in the `Authorization` header in a string, with the format: `Bearer {token}`. For instance, if your token was `\"as9d8f7as\"` then header would be: `Bearer as9d8f7as`.\n\nThis token is intended to be an opaque string which is granted once a client successfully logins to a system. The client then provides this token in subsequent requests to continue to prove it has access to the resources/APIs it is requesting.\n\nOur server has an `/api/headers` endpoint setup for this challenge.

[HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) are used to represent the \"state\" of a response to a request. This is basically how you know if the request was successful or not. Don't forget \\- if you are ever making a network request the request could fail for 1,001 different reasons\\!\n\nThere are 5 main status code categories, \"one hundred\" level status codes, i.e. `100`, `101`, or `102`, \"two hundred\" level codes such as `200`, `201`, etc. and then `3.x.x`, `4.x.x`, and `5.x.x`. Generally, each level has a specific meaning:\n\n* `100`: Information response.\n* `200`: Success response.\n* `300`: Redirection response.\n* `400`: Client error \\(e.g. bad request or unauthorized\\).\n* `500`: Server error \\(the server failed to process the request for some reason\\).\n\n\nWithin each \"hundred\" level of status codes, a particular code is used to convey a specific reason/context in the response, e.g. `400` is used to represent that something was wrong with the client's request whereas `401` is used to indicate the client's request could not be fulfilled because the client does not have access or is unauthorized to make that request.\n\nOne of these codes will be included in the response object \\(e.g. the [Fetch Response object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)\\) in the result of making an HTTP request. For instance:\n\n```typescript\nconst makeRequest = async (url: string) => {\n    const response = await fetch(url);\n    // The status information is present on the response object:\n    const { status, statusText } = response;\n    console.log(status);\n    console.log(statusText);\n};\n\n```\n\nThe `statusText` is additional text associated with the response.\n\nThe response will also contain additional information, as mentioned above, such as response headers and the response type \\- feel free to read on the details more if you are interested.\n\nFor our purposes here, the main takeaway is to learn how to interpret HTTP response status codes.

          "content": "So far we have been primarily using the built\\-in `fetch` API to make network requests. This is handy and easy because it's built in to the JavaScript browser environment as a global method you can call at anytime. You can simply open a browser console and call `fetch` with an URL to quickly make a `GET` request\\.\n\nBut in the last challenge we also saw the underlying `XMLHttpRequest` object, which also allows us to interact with servers. The `XMLHttpRequest` is more low level and a lot more difficult to use compared to `fetch`, however.\n\nBut these are not the only utilities available to you to make network requests\\! Let's introduce a few other libraries which you can use.\n# NodeJS\n\nIf you are working in NodeJS \\(outside of the browser\\) the `fetch` API won't be available anymore. NodeJS has a built in `http` module \\([documentation here](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)\\) which you can use, but, it's more likely you will  install a node module to do this. Here are two good options:\n\n* [node\\-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch): A light\\-weight module that brings `window.fetch` to NodeJS.\n* [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): Promise based HTTP client for the browser and NodeJS.\n\n# NodeJS/Browsers\n\nIf you are working purely in a browser, `fetch` is probably your best option. But, if you're building an app for a browser where you can install node modules, we recommend using axios. Axios, all around is a great library for making HTTP requests.\n# Axios\n\nUsing `axios` is as simple as installing it:\n\n```bash\nyarn add axios\n\n```\n\nImporting it:\n\n```\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\n```\n\nAnd using it:\n\n```\nconst getUsers = async () => {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.get('/users');\n    console.log(response);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nIt's as easy as that\\! It's also easy to add headers and making other types of requests is simple with `axios.put` or `axios.post`. We recommend trying add axios anytime when you need to work with asynchronous code. Feel free to try it out in the projects for this module."

          "content": "Finally, we can introduce this confusing term \"Application Programming Interface\" or \"API\" for short.\n# What is an \"API\"?\n\nAn API is simply the rules for interacting with a system. Most ordinary objects and tools have the equivalent of an \"API\". For instance, the API of an oven is the knobs, timer, and settings you use to set the temperature and use the oven. The API of a car is how you use the key, steering wheel, and pedals to drive and stop the car.\n\nAn API is simply the rules for how you interact with some mechanical or computerized system to get that system to do things you want.\n\nIf you want a car to move, you have to get in, turn it on with the key, and press the gas pedal. This is the \"API\" for interacting with a car.\n# APIs in Software\n\n\"API\" is a very common term thrown around in software. People talk about that API of a library, or the API of some class, or a server API, or a database API, or system APIs, and so on.\n\nWhenever you are building software, you will always have to interact with other code and other software systems. How these interactions occur is dictated by the API, or application programming interface, between these pieces of code or software systems.\n# A Practical Example\n\nIn the last few lessons we made a few HTTP requests to our sample Pairwise HTTP server. That server exposes a simple HTTP API which we have been using in these challenges. The API comprises a few endpoints under the `/api` path which you can make HTTP requests to. It's very simple, but that is in fact an API.\n\nWhen you work on other systems, as a client you will have backend server APIs you have to interact with. For instance, the Pairwise application you are using is interacting with backend APIs in one of our servers to handle authenticating you, storing your progress in the course, and making other updates.\n# APIs as Interfaces\n\nAPIs are basically just the interfaces between different aspects of software and programs. Here's a few more examples:\n\n* You want to save data in the local storage of a browser. You will use the browser `localStorage` API for this.\n* You want to fetch data from some server which has data about the current weather \\- you will need to use the server's API to make these requests.\n* You are building a mobile app and want to take advantage of the gestures or positioning sensors of the phone \\- you will need to make use of some built\\-in APIs to do this.\n\n\nGenerally, there are two main categories you can think about for APIs:\n\n1. **External Server APIs:** These refer to the API for interacting with some other server and require actually sending network requests. These could be a server you control, or some external server someone else controls.\n1. **\"Software/Code\" APIs:** These refer to interacting with other code, functions, classes, libraries, software etc. For instance, people may take about the \"ReactJS API\", or the \"Fetch API\", or \"that class has a really bad API\" \\(referring to some class in the codebase you're working on\\).\n\n\nThe term API has the same abstract meaning, but in either case what it directly refers to is different.\n# API Documentation\n\nWhen you use an API, it likely means you are using some code or software you didn't write and you don't have control over. How do you know how to use it?\n\nYou have to read the manual of course\\!\n\nAll good software should come with well written and up to date documentation describing how exactly to use it. This is sometimes referred to as the \"manual\", but more often just as documentation, API documentation, or the \"docs\".\n\nIf you are using an API for some external service, they will provide some API documentation for what endpoints they expose, how to use them, and what data to expect in response. For example, take a look at the [OpenWeather API documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api). On the other hand, if you are using the ExpressJS library to build a server and you want to look up how to handle `GET` requests you can find this information in [their documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html). Or, maybe you are using a language like TypeScript and you are confused about the \"language API\" for creating types or interface. You can find some helpful guidelines in the [TypeScript language docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).\n# The Important of APIs\n\nIt's a pretty common skill to get used to reading and using API documentation to understand how to interact with and use APIs. In fact, this is a major aspect of working as a developer. Modern software applications are complex and typically interact with many other systems. This means asynchronous interactions, possible errors, and troubleshooting/debugging external APIs. It's an important skill to master\\!\n\nWe will get some more practice working with external APIs in the projects for this module."

When you make a request to the short URL, the service can use its database record to find the original URL and then redirect the request to that URL.\n\nThe [Relink Service](https://rel.ink/) provides an API to do this, which you can easily try out on their website. Take a look at their service and then implement a class which makes use of their API to shorten URLs \\- very handy\\! Good luck\\!",

They do have paid plans, but if you look at their [pricing model](https://weatherstack.com/product) they provide a free plan as long as you use less than 1,000 calls per month. This is a very common approach for API providers. A free tier provides limited functionality which allows developers to try out the service, and then paid tiers provide more advanced features or unlimited usage.\n\nTo use their API, you will have to sign up and obtain an \\_api key, \\_which in this case they refer to as an _access\\_key_. Basically, this is just a unique key you must obtain to use their API. To obtain it you can follow the steps in the [Getting Started Documentation](https://weatherstack.com/documentation). This key allows their service to authenticate your requests, and, if you have a paid plan, ensure you have access to the paid features.\n\nIt may feel tedious to read through their documentation and sign up for an account to get this API key, but in fact you will find that this process is an integral aspect of working as a developer \\- and this is one of the major lessons and takeaways from this module on Async Programming and APIs. You will very frequently have to work with 3rd party systems, and, if you are using or building production services, you often have to register and authenticate with the APIs you are consuming, just like we are doing here\\!\n\nThat's one reason why we chose this challenge. It's an easy introduction to this process of working with 3rd party APIs which enforce authentication logic. Now, on to the project details\\!\n# User Stories\n\nHere are some user stories for the project. They are relatively short and to the point:\n\n* As a user, I can run a program on the command line to fetch current weather details for some location.\n* As a user, I can pass in the location I want to search using an argument, e.g.\n   * Sample command: `node weather.js --location=Tokyo`.\n\n\nThat's it\\! You just have to build a simple NodeJS program which can be run on the command line and accepts an argument for the location you want to search the weather for. The program should then output the current weather information using the weather API we described above.\n\nAs in the other projects, build your project and push your code to GitHub. Then enter your project URL in this page to complete the project.\n# Hints\n\n* Take a look at the \"Current Weather\" API provided by Weatherstack and the \"Query Parameter\" section on how to provide a weather location. All of this information is in the [API Documentation](https://weatherstack.com/documentation).\n* There are a few libraries to help with reading command line arguments for NodeJS programs. While NodeJS has the built\\-in [process\\.argv](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_argv), which you are free to explore, two other node modules you can use are:\n   * [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs)\n   * [command\\-line\\-args](https://www.npmjs.com/package/command-line-args)\n   * Take your pick from these, or search around and find another option\\!\n\n# Challenge\n\nIf you are interested in a challenge here's a few suggestions:\n\n* The Weatherstack API also provides some other options in addition to the current weather, such as historical weather and weather forecast. Take a look at these other APIs and consider adding some more options to your CLI tool to allow users to query these APIs as well.\n* Currently the program accepts a location argument. Modify your program to make the location argument optional. If it is not provided, the program should provide a prompt for the user to enter a location. Once a location is searched, the prompt should reappear so the user can search another location. Add error handling in case the location is invalid or the API request failed. In this case, the user should see some error output and be able to enter another location.\n\n"

The outcome is decided by the rules of the game:\n      * Rock beats scissors.\n      * Paper beats rock.\n      * Scissors beat paper.\n   * If a round ends in a tie, the round repeats.\n   * The first player to win 2 out of 3 rounds wins the game.\n   * The winner's score increases by one.\n* As a user, I can play multiple games against the computer player. The computer player should always randomly choose Rock Paper or Scissors to make the game fair.\n\n# Completing the Project\n\nBuild your program as a NodeJS project. We recommend using the regular project setup we have outlined in the course. Your program should have a `README.md` document which describes how to build and run the program in order to play the game.\n\nCommit your progress and when you are finished push your project to GitHub. Add the link to your project repository here to complete the project challenge.\n# Hints\n\nNodeJS has a built\\-in [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) utility which can help you read input from the command line. But like many things in software, other developers have built and open sourced their own libraries which provide higher level abstractions with great APIs for you to do simple things like this. Check our the [Prompts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompts) library for a good option for easily reading user input. Good luck\\!"

You know the ins and outs of a popular programming language, you have a set of tools to work as a modern developer, and you understand how to write code which interacts with other computer systems. This is an important milestone in your learning journey\\!\n\nWhat you have learned so far will be transferrable to any other programming language you decide to learn in the future\\! Take a moment to congratulate yourself, and get ready to dive further down the rabbit hole.\n---\n\n### Enter React\n\nNow we will embark on the journey of the learning numerous tools, libraries, and frameworks which will equip you to build modern, real\\-world applications. Software engineers do not write everything from scratch. Instead, they use existing software as much as possible. React is the first tool like this for you to learn.\n\nReact is a library for building user interfaces.\n\nThe site you are looking at right now is built with React. React is built and open sourced by Facebook, and if you use any of the Facebook products you have used applications powered by React. React is very popular and the leading choice for building user interfaces. In the software development industry, React is one of the most in demand skills. In addition, it's very versatile. You can write web apps, mobile apps, and even desktop apps using React.\n\nBut what is a user interface library, exactly?\n\nIt's a tool which let's you build the frontend, or user interface, of an application very easily. It provides abstractions to handle common tasks and operations efficiently, safely, and easily. For example, consider this code:\n\n```typescript\nconst Greeting = (name?: string) => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <h1>\n                {name ? `Hello, ${name}` : \"Hello and welcome!\"}\n            </h1>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\n```\n\nThis code may look strange, and slightly \\(un\\)familiar to you. It may look like TypeScript. Or it may remind you of HTML. Or it may resemble a mishmash of both together. Well, it's exactly that\\! Another name for it is JSX \\(a syntax extension of JavaScript\\), but you will come to recognize this simply as _React\\._\n\nWhat it does is simple. It's a function which greets you by `name`, if you provide the function with a `name` argument, otherwise it displays a default greeting. React allows you to build HTML directly with the power of a programming language.\n\nIn this module, we will learn all about it\\!"

For instance, the server for Pairwise receives numerous requests as you work through the course. The client frontend sends updates on your progress which the server processes and records. When you signup and login the server handles these requests and creates a user entry for you in a database which the server can access. It stores your progress in association with this user. And, it does this for all the users who access Pairwise. The server is \\(should be\\) always available to handle requests from client applications.\n\nServers may seem daunting\\! But don't worry, they are just computer programs and you learned everything you need to write computer programs in the first course modules. Servers are just composed of functions, classes, and data structures.\n\nIn general, a typical server exposes an API for clients to send it requests. It then has a layer of business logic which handles processing client requests, storing and updating data. Then, finally, it has another layer which is responsible for interacting with a database and persisting or retrieving data.\n\nAs you might imagine, there are many tools and libraries for writing server applications which provide some of the common scaffolding and features modern servers require.\n\nIn this module, we will learn about some of these tools and get some practice building and thinking about some of the common components servers use.

Databases are crucial to building modern software applications. They are responsible for storing and backing up the data which makes your applications valuable. Whether it's user profiles, chat messages, transaction records, inventory, or anything else, these are all stored and persisted in a database.\n\nAt a basic level, a database is just a hard disk on a computer where information is stored. As we will see, there are several different types of databases, which are all used for different purposes. Like many things in software engineering, there are tradeoffs to choosing one database type over another.\n\nThe two most common types of databases are relational and non\\-relational. SQL is the canonical relational database, which you may have heard of before.  A SQL database defines a strict schema for what data and relationships between data look like. If you are using a SQL database you can rely on the database schema to enforce integrity for your data.\n\nOn the other hand, a non\\-relational database doesn't have a strict schema like a SQL database does. Non\\-relational databases are great when you have unstructured data, data in inconsistent formats, data with an unknown format, or other types of flexible requirements. Common non\\-relational databases are MongoDB and Redis, along with several others.\n\nIn this module, we will learn the basics for these different types of databases and get some practice working directly writing, reading, and updating data.

          "content": "In this module you will learn the basics of programming mobile apps. Specifically, you will learn React Native, a cross\\-platform technology which allows developers to build iOS and Android apps with a single codebase.\n\n### The History\n\nFirst, a quick word of introduction and history about mobile apps.\n\nMobile apps began to exist with the invention of the iPhone in 2007. Since then, smart phones and mobile apps have grown tremendously. Traditionally mobile app development has required app developers to develop separate applications for different platforms. This is because the dominant platforms, iOS and Android, are totally different and therefore apps on these platforms are built using different technologies and programming languages which are specialized for those devices.\n\nTraditionally, \"native\" mobile apps are written using Objective\\-C or Swift on iOS, and Java or Kotlin on Android. However, product teams want their apps to provide a consistent experience across both platforms, but this can be challenging for engineering teams which must build and maintain completely separate codebases in different languages which attempt to duplicate the same features, functionality, and user experiences on multiple devices.\n\nIt breaks one of the fundamental rules of programming: **Don't Repeat Yourself.**\n\n### Cross Platform Mobile Frameworks\n\nIn the past few years, several \"cross\\-platform frameworks\" have emerged which allow developers to write mobile apps using a single codebase and language. These apps are then compiled to run on the specific target device, whether that is iOS or Android, or some other target.\n\nThis provides huge benefits: engineering teams can focus on maintaining a single codebase which runs on both platforms. Product teams can move more quickly iterating product ideas and building new features. However, the drawback is that these frameworks tend to experience some disadvantages compared to writing a native app. For instance, native apps tend to have better performance, more seamless user device interactions, and can use some native device APIs more effectively.\n\n### React Native\n\nThat being said, there is still a strong shift in the adoption of cross\\-platform frameworks for mobile app development. As you may know, there is a framework which allows you to write mobile apps using React called _React Native_. It works by running a JavaScript application \\(i.e. React\\) directly on the mobile device and then transforming React's UI updates to update the UI on the phone \\(instead of the HTML UI of a webpage\\). Don't worry about the complexities of how it works right now, we can cover that in a special topic lesson later. The beautiful thing is you don't have to understand the implementation details in order to use the framework effectively.\n\nThere are also a few other frameworks like React Native, another popular one is Flutter.\n\n### This Module\n\nHere, we will get some experience with React Native. You will find that writing React Native apps requires learning almost nothing new if you already know React\\! This is really powerful. There are some specific device APIs which exist for mobile apps which are not present on the web, but other than that your existing knowledge is fully transferrable to the world of mobile.\n\nLet's start writing some mobile apps\\!"

          "content": "In this module you will learn about how to test software and automate common tasks in order to improve productivity. The idea of testing software is to create automated tests which will verify your software performs correctly and provides the functionality users expect. The value of tests is to give teams confidence to ship changes to software projects and know that their changes did not break some existing behavior or feature.\n\n> At a high level, software testing is intended to ensure your software works as expected, and will not break unexpectedly, once it is out in the wild.\n\n## An Example: Regressions\n\nRegressions occur when you change some code and something totally seemingly unrelated breaks. If you continue on your journey of learning to code you will definitely experience it one day. Regressions happen like this:\n\n* You spend 3 weeks building a new feature in a product to let users post comments on some posts.\n* You ship the feature.\n* The next day at work, someone asks \"Hey, is the user login broken?\"\n* You sit still and start listening and thinking, nervous.\n* You didn't touch the user login, you probably didn't break it.... you say to yourself.\n* Someone else confirms: \"Yes, it appears to be broken\".\n* \"What happened\"? Another person says.\n* ... You are frozen now.\n* A while later, it is discovered how your new feature inadvertently broke the user login.\n* You rush to try to fix the problem and deploy an update to production.\n\n\n## Best Practice Testing\n\nThis is a regression, is this is exactly the type of thing software testing is intended to prevent. Ideally, a best practice workflow would look like this:\n\n* You build the feature.\n* You open a pull request to merge your feature into the main branch of your team's codebase.\n* Automated tests run to check the code on your feature branch.\n* The tests check the user login feature, and the tests fail.\n* You immediately see feedback that the user login is broken on your branch.\n* You debug the problem and fix it.\n* You update your branch, the tests run again and pass.\n* All of this happens in a safe testing environment, doesn't impact any users, and doesn't require any manual human interaction.\n* You ship your feature, and this time sleep peacefully at night knowing the code works and will not cause any fires in production.\n\n\nThe hard part, of course, is writing tests which truly verify an application's intended functionality works correctly. You will find that it's impossible to test all the ways a user could think of to break an application. And, it's important that tests are easy to read, write, understand, in addition to being simple and fast to run. You don't want to spend more time working on tests than you do building the business logic which supports your product.\n\n## Automation\n\nThis module will walk through a lot of techniques for testing software and also touch on a related topic: automation. Writing tests for your software is fundamentally an application of automation: you could check your software manually every time but this is tedious, time\\-consuming, and error\\-prone. Instead, \nwriting tests always you to automate this process.\n\nHowever, automation goes beyond developing tests. Automation also involves building tools to help you write software more quickly, debug problems, and deploy software.\n\nLearning how to automate tasks is a force\\-multiplier skill for software engineers and very important to learn. In this module we will get some practice automating tasks and learning about common ways automation is used in the software development process."

As it terms out, the skills of debugging and refactoring are indispensable for software developers. They are as important as writing code correctly from scratch.\n\nIn this module, we will equip you with tools and techniques which will make you more effective at debugging code, and we will walk through some strategies for refactoring code as well. In addition, we will provide a number of challenges were there is some mistake in the code that you must find, debug and fix. There will be other challenges to give you specific practice refactoring existing code to change the design or organization.\n\nLet's dive in\\!"

This is one of the last important topics on your journey to becoming a software engineer\\!\n\nIt's not enough to just write your apps, you have to still deploy them so users can access them\\! This can be a lot more complicated than you may think at first.\n\nYour client application must be hosted somewhere so it can be served quickly to your users when they visit a page and make a request for your app.\n\nYour server must be deployed in the cloud somewhere, possibly with multiple instances running. You need to have monitoring, alerting, and logging so you know if your server encounters any issues, failures, or errors. Maybe you also need rate limiting, caching, and other configuration and setup.\n\nYou database must be deployed, backed up, and possibly supplied with read replicas for performance. It should be secure and only accessible by your production server or possibly administrator users.\n\nAnd that's just a very simple setup\\!\n\nFinally, as your team makes changes to your applications updates should be delivered and deployed to your production system continuously. You never want to hit a big red \"Deploy the App\" button. Ideally, deployments ship continuously as you merge code, tests run automatically and stop deployments when they fail, and your technical team can focus their efforts on building business logic and features rather than fighting fires or troubleshooting manual deployment nightmare scenarios.\n\nAs you can start to see... this world of \"devops\" \\(developer operations\\) is a lot more complex than it may seem at first. That's why it is such an important skillset to be familiar with as a developer. Having an effective devops and infrastructure setup can make the difference between a team being agile, shipping quickly, and out\\-running their competition and a team which is constantly fighting fires and afraid to deploy any new code because of regressions and brittle build pipelines.\n\nLet's get started\\!"
