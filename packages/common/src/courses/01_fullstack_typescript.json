Together, they give you a complete education in full\\-stack software development. Pairwise can give you all the skills to start a new career in software development. Our curriculum focuses on teaching **TypeScript, React, **and** NodeJS**. If you are curious more about why we chose these technologies, feel free to [read our rationale here](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum).\n\nYou can access the course navigation by clicking the menu icon in the top left. This is always available for you to navigate to any challenge.\n\nThe first two modules introduce HTML/CSS and TypeScript, so they cover many of the basics of web development and programming. These two modules are completely free and no signup is required\\! However, you can create an account at any time \\(also free\\!\\) to track your progress \\(don't worry, we will track your progress even if you don't have an account yet\\).\n\nIf you do decide to continue and complete the entire course, there will be a one\\-time payment which will give you lifetime access to the course. You can make this payment with a credit card at anytime after signing up.\n\nThe primary mode of learning is through short, interactive coding challenges like the one you just solved. If you persist through the entire course, you will also build up a portfolio of projects you build and deploy on your own\\! You can use this portfolio as a showcase of your skills to future employers.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nEnough talking\\! To start learning you just need to start on the next challenge. Each challenge should just take 5\\-10 minutes to complete and will be simple and interactive just like the last. We know you're eager to click that **Next Challenge** button, but before you do we encourage you to watch this short video tutorial of how to use the _Pairwise Workspace_. It will give you some helpful tips which will help you get started, and after that we'll get out of your way\\! Good luck and welcome\\!"

          "content": "HTML is the reason there is anything online to look at. It's ubiquitous online because without it there would be nothing. When you visit Facebook or Google or Reddit you're reading HTML. You're reading HTML right now.\n# What is HTML?\n\nHTML is a language for putting content into web browsers and telling browsers what content means what. Consider the following items:\n\n* Some plain text\n* Some _bold italic_ text\n* Some `code` text\n\n\nIt's easy to tell the difference and that's the point. Different parts of a webpage mean different things, and as programmers we need a way of telling a web browser what's what.\n\nLet's take another example. Consider the list above. Howe does the browser know that its' a list? How does it know to include a small dot in front of the text? The answer is HTML. \n\nConsider what that three\\-item list looks like to you, the reader, and also consider what it looks like in code:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li>Some plain text</li>\n  <li>\n    Some <strong><em>bold italic</em></strong> text\n  </li>\n  <li>Some <code>code</code> text</li>\n</ul>\n\n```\n\nIt looks quite different\\! The code above is what the browser sees. A `ul` with some `li`s inside tell the browser we want a list. Putting some text inside a `strong` and an `em` will make the text **bold** and _italic_ respectively\\. \n# Why are we learning HTML?\n\nA few reasons: \n\n* It's visual\n* It gives you real skills, quickly\n* It's foundational\n\n\nHere's what this in more detail.\n\n## 1\\. It's visual\n\nWhat you write in code will appear on screen. This is hugely important when you're first learning. Programmers specialize in telling computers what to do, and computers don't always give you visual feedback to let you know that your commands are achieving the desired result.\n\nThink about the clock on your phone. Seem simple right? It shows the time. It also adjusts for daylight savings time, or if you physically enter a different timezone. It can display the time in 24\\-hour format or AM\\-PM format. Consider this:\n\n* How does your phone know the time? \n* How does the clock update when daylight savings time shifts or when you step off of a plan? \n\n\nThis functionality, which we all take for granted, was programmed by someone. Imagine you are that person. If you program the phone to update its time based on your GPS location, how do you know it worked? There's no immediate visual feedback to tell you whether your code worked or not.\n\nIf you're writing HTML there is visual feedback, so you will know immediately if your code is doing what you want it to.\n\n## 2\\. It gives you real skills, quickly\n\nIf you learn the basics of HTML, guess what? You can make your own website. In fact, in this course we'll walk you through creating a website from scratch and getting it online for free. \n\nAt the end of this module you will be able to build something real, that you can see online and show to other people. In fact, using just the skills in this first module you can even build websites for other people and **get paid to do it**. There are many people around the world who make a living this way. \n\nOf course our goal is to give you the skills to be a full software engineer so we will go well beyond HTML. Which brings us to the final point...\n\n## 3\\. It's foundational\n\nHTML is everywhere, and not just on the web.\n\nConsider Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc. These massive companies all rely on HTML. They all have mobile apps too, but the web component is a significant part of their business.\n\nConsider also that the principles you learn while building HTML can translate into mobile app development as well. We will touch on this significantly in later parts of the course. For now, let's focus on HTML and dive in.\n# HTML Syntax\n\n\n## Tags\n\nAll those things you saw in the code at the beginning of the lesson, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, etc. are called tags. Don't worry, you don't have to remember this yet, but you will over time because this is how programmers talk about HTML and how we walk about it in our videos. \n\n### Anatomy of an HTML tag\n\nTags usually have two parts:\n\n* The opening tag\n* The closing tag\n\nOpening tags include a `<` symbol, followed by the name of the tag, followed by the `>` symbol\\. Closing tags are almost exactly the same. The only difference is that closing tags have a `/` symbol right after the `<`. Example:\n\n* `<p>I'm a paragraph</p>`\n\n\nReading through one character at a time, the opening \"P tag\" is `<` \\+ `p` \\+ `>`. The closing P tag is `<` \\+ `/` \\+ `p` \\+ `>`. You can use this rule for every tag you write. \n\nHere are a few more examples. Try to see the pattern of opening `<` \\+ tag name \\+ `>` and closing `</` \\+ tag name \\+ `>`.\n\n* `<a>Link</a>`\n* `<button>Click me</button>`\n* `<h1>Heading text</h1>`\n\n\n### Self\\-closing tags\n\nNot all tags have to correspond to a closing tags. Sometimes it wouldn't make sense to have any text inside the tag. For example, a `<p>` means a paragraph so you would expect some text inside. However, an `<img>` tag means an image and a `<video>` means a video. When you see one of these tags the browser knows to show the actual image or the actual video that the tag corresponds to, so there is no need to write additional text inside the tag. This is also true of input fields, where you can type things in to a webpage. Ever logged in to a site? Yeah, like that.\n\nHere are some common tags that are self\\-closing. \n\n* `<img />`\n* `<video />`\n* `<input />`\n\n\nNotice the syntax here. It's like the opening tag and closing tag got smushed together because there's nothing in between:\n\n* `<img></img>` becomes `<img />`\n* `<video></video>` becomes `<video />`\n* `<input></input>` becomes `<input />`\n\n\n## Properties\n\nThe final piece before we dive in to some code\\! Properties tell the browser things about the tag itself. This will become more clear with examples. Consider the `<img />` tag mentioned above. That points to an image, but how does the browser now what image? With a property.\n\n```markup\n<img src=\"https://placekitten.com/g/200/200\" />\n\n```\n\nThe key above is the `src` property\\. The syntax for properties looks like: property name \\+ `=` \\+ `\"` \\+ property value \\+ `\"`. All of this goes inside the opening tag, which is the only tag if it's self\\-closing like the `<img />` above\\.\n\nNow consider another example, perhaps the single most important property in all of HTML. The `href`:\n\n```markup\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/\">Don't click me if you value your time...</a>\n\n```\n\nThe `a` tag is the \"link\" on the web. It's what you click when after searching for something, or when shopping, or when doing research. It's a fundamental part of the web. Web pages include `a` tags which link to other pages. Without links the internet would just be a bunch of disperate web pages that you had to visit directly by typing the address into your browser. OK, back on topic.\n\nThe `href` property of the `a` tag tells the browser where to send someone when they click the link. \n\nThese examples are just meant to be an overview, in the coming challenges you'll use all these tags directly. There's no substitute for hands\\-on practice. Onward\\!"

If you are interested, take a look at the [MDN HTML reference page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) for a more exhaustive list of all of the HTML tags which exist. There's no need to memorize all of these, but a brief overview should help paint a picture of all of the different elements HTML has to offer.\n\n### Styles with CSS\n\nThe next section will introduce CSS, which will build upon your current HTML skills to start adding life and color to your HTML document. CSS allows you to color and shape HTML elements to create custom appearances and layouts for your webpages.\n\nWith HTML and CSS, you can create beautiful webpages but to really transform them into functional web applications you need a programming language.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is the programming language of the web. All web browsers can run JavaScript programs, and any functionality you use on websites is typically built using JavaScript. Once you complete the CSS section, the next course module will be a deep dive into programming with a special dialect of JavaScript, _TypeScript\\._\n\nTypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to JavaScript. Don't worry about the details here yet: we will cover them in depth once we get to the TypeScript section. This programming section will lay the foundation for everything which comes later.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nAfter the TypeScript module, we will have covered the foundations of HTML/CSS and programming. You will understand the basics of how webpages are made and you will have a thorough grasp of a modern programming language.\n\nFrom there, the course will get into the modern skills, tools, and workflows software engineers use to build complex applications, servers, and mobile apps. There's a lot to learn, but as you will see all of this is built on the basic foundation you are learning now\\!\n\nLet's continue\\!\n"

          "content": "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, but that's unimportant. What matters here is that what CSS is how you change the way things _look_ on the web.\n\nWhere HTML is the \"stuff\", the actual content on a webpage, CSS is how all that stuff looks. Is the background dark with light text \\(like what you're reading right now\\)? Is there a menu bar near the top? How does the form on screen try to grab your attention with color and positioning? These are all questions CSS can answer.\n\nTo be specific, CSS tells the browser two things:\n\n* What we want to style\n* What we want it to look like\n\n# Selectors\n\nSelectors tell the browser what you want to style.\n\nFor example, you might say to yourself \"I want all the paragraphs on my site to be red\\!\" A very elegant design decision. In order to communicate this to the browser we can use CSS:\n\n```css\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n```\n\nRemember the `<p>` tag from earlier lessons? Using the tagname, `p`, we were able to \"select\" every paragraph on the page and make them all red. In this example `p` is the selector. Now let's talk about what's inside those brackets.\n# Properties\n\nCSS properties tell the browser how you want something to look. Let's say you're tired of drab white\\-background websites and want to mix it up with a `teal` background\\.\n\n```css\nbody {\n  background: teal;\n}\n\n```\n\n`body` will select the entire visible area of the web page, but we will touch on that more later. Focus on `background: teal;`. Here we have another CSS property `background` with a value of `teal`.\n\n> CSS properties take the form: property name \\+ `:` \\+ property value \\+ `;`.\n\n`background` and `color` are just two examples. There are quite a few CSS properties you can use, and the combination of them is responsible for styling every site you use on the internet.\n\nIf you're curious you can skim through [the full list of CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference), but we don't recommend it. It's a very dry read and by itself won't tell you what you really want to know which is what each property does. Furthermore, some CSS properties are so obscure that you can go your entire career without learning them on the job because they are just not useful in most context.\n# Blocks\n\nA \"block\" of CSS is simply the combination of selectors and properties. All the examples above are CSS blocks.\n\n> CSS blocks take the form: Selectors \\+ `{` \\+ properties \\+ `}`\n\nThese terms are not important for their own sake, but so that you aren't lost when you're working outside of this course. \n# The <style\\> tag connects HTML and CSS\n\nYou can't just write CSS anywhere in an HTML document and expect it to work. You have to write it **within a \\*\\***`style`**\\*\\* tag**. Like this:\n\n```html\n<style>\n  p { color: red; }\n</style>\n<p>Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nIf you write that without the `style` tag the browser will literally put `p { color: red; }` on the page for everyone to see. By putting that CSS code within a `style` tag you are telling the browser to treat it as CSS rather than HTML.\n# Specificity and the HTML class and id props\n\nImagine you have two paragraphs, and you want one to be `red` and the other to be `blue`. How would you select just one? Here's the HTML:\n\n```html\n<p>I want a blue background</p>\n<p>I want a red background</p>\n\n```\n\nYou might try the following CSS:\n\n```\np { background: red; }\np { background: blue; }\n\n```\n\nHowever, both paragraphs will be `blue`\\! Why? Two things are happening here:\n\n1. `p` selects every `<p>` tag, not just the first or the second.\n1. When you have two identical selectors \\(`p` and `p` above\\) and two identical property names \\(`background` and `background` above\\) whichever one comes last wins.\n\nPoint 1 can be addressed with IDs and classes, which we will discuss shortly.\n\nPoint 2, how conflicting styles get applied by the browser, is called \"specificity\". As in, the second CSS block is considered more _specific_ than the first, and therefore it wins and gets applied.\n\n## IDs\n\nAn ID is a unique identifier in the browser and it can be used as a selector. \n\n* There should only be 1 of any ID on a web page.\n* IDs are very specific, meaning if you select an ID in your CSS that CSS will most likely win over other styles\n* HTML uses the `id` property, CSS uses the `#` selector\\.\n\n\n```html\n<style>\n  #my-paragraph { color: red; }\n  p { color: blue; }\n</style>\n<p id=\"my-paragraph\">Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nEven though the `p` styles come last, the `#my-paragraph` styles get applied because they are more specific.\n\n> In general don't use IDs, use classes.\n\n## Classes\n\n* A class can be applied to as many things as you want.\n* Classes are more specific than tag names\n* HTML uses the `class` property, CSS uses the `.` selector\\.\n\n\n```markup\n<style>\n  .red-text { color: red; }\n  p { color: blue; }\n</style>\n<p class=\"red-text\">Red text!</p>\n\n```\n\nThe text is again red because classes are more specific than tag names.\n\n> Classes are extremely useful and flexible. Use them a lot.\n# More to come...\n\nThat's a lot of information, and mostly meaningless without practice. There's more to CSS which we will dive into later, but for now let's practice everything we just talked about."

The most simple is what we've been doing so far, which is using colors that have names like `blue`, `red`, `black`, `green`, etc. However, if you had to rely on colors that have names you would be quite limited. HTML let's you define any custom color you want using some different syntax, namely HEX codes. For example, the color `white` can also be written `#ffffff`. Likewise `black` is `#000000` and `blue` is `#0000ff`. \n\nIn the meantime you can use named colors. There are quite a few, and often if you guess a color it will exist.

          "content": "I'm no fan of jargon, but sometimes you just gotta learn it. The \"box model\" is one such case because the concepts that fall under the box model are vital to being fluent in CSS.\n# What is the box model?\n\nThe official CSS documentation gives a nice overview:\n\n>  Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.\n\nTo put this another way, the box model is how elements are visually arranged on a web page. Now let's get a bit more concrete. There are a number of CSS properties that fall under the banner of the box model that we will be concerned with:\n\n* `width` and `height`: How wide or tall an element is.\n* `margin`: Visual space between elements.\n* `border`: Space around an element between it's `margin` and `padding`.\n* `display`: How an element interacts with other elements on the page. \n\n# The first line of all your CSS: border\\-box\n\nUtilizing the box model with regard to `width`,`height`, `margin`, `border`, and `padding` used to be tricky. The _visual_ size of an element—how large it looks to your eyes on screen—would be calculated as the sum of `width` or `height` \\+ `margin` \\+ `border` \\+ `padding`. This was unintuitive. When you say `width: 300px` you generally expect the element to be `300px` wide\\. \n\nIn fact, that behavior is still the default in browsers, which can make it difficult or time consuming to style your applications. However, **there is a better way**\\! Enter `box-sizing: border-box`.\n\n```css\n* {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat is this line doing?\n* `*` is selecting **everything** on the page. Every element. It's a special selector.\n* `box-sizing: border-box` Tells the browser that we want the `width` and `height` properties to determine the _visual_ width and _visual_ height of elements on the page.\n\n\n## A concrete example\n\nThis is all fairly abstract, so here's some code to help. You can drop this into the Sandbox and compare the visual difference between the two `div` elements\\. If you run this code in the sandbox you will notice that the content of the first `div` has the exact same width as the entire second `div`. \n\n```markup\n<style>\n  strong {\n    display: block;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n  div {\n    background: white;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    margin-top: 20px;\n  }\n  .outer {\n    background: lightblue;\n    width: 300px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border: 5px solid tomato;\n  }\n  .border-box {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"outer\">\n  <div>\n    <h3>Standard Box Model</h3>\n    <p>\n      This div shows how the box model works by default.

          "content": "# What are margins?\n\n> A margin is the visual space between one HTML element and another.\n\nUsing margins you can move elements away from each other to create visual space. However, you can also do this with `padding` and `border` so let's look at the differences between the three concepts. \n\n## How is this difference with padding ?\n\n* Padding is the visual space between an elements _content_ and it's edges\n* In other words, `padding` is visual space within an element while `margin` is visual space around \\(outside\\) an element.\n\n\n## How does margin relate to border ?\n\n* The `border` is between an elements `margin` and `padding` , and it usually has a color applied to it.\n\n# Beware, margins will \"collapse\"\n\nThere's a trick margins do that might confuse you when you first come across it: Margins will _collapse\\. _\n\nWhat this means is:\n\n> If two margins touch each other, they will _not combine_ but instead will collapse in to each other. This means the visual margin will only be as big as the larger of the two, not the combination of the two.\n\nFor now it's enough to know that this quirk exists. There's no good way to learn about this quirk other than to have it bite you while building an application. \n# When should I use margins?\n\nGenerally, when you want to move one element away from another element. Some examples:\n\n* You have a navigation menu of links and you want space between them\n* You want space between paragraphs in a blog post\n   * Consider the space between the paragraphs you're reading right now. You could do that with margins.\n* When you want to center something on the page \\(see below\\)\n\n\nUsing margins for centering is a special use case, which might not be obvious but is extremely common.\n# Margin auto\n\nThere's a special value you can use for margins called `auto`. For example:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat `auto` does is it tells the browser to \\_auto\\_matically use as much space as possible given all other margins. So, what the code above does is it moves anything with the `.centered` class to the center of the page.\n\nAs with most CSS properties, `margin` has a shorthand syntax that is commonly used for centering something on the page:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis example is equivalent to the long\\-hand version:\n\n```css\n.centered {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n\n```\n"

          "content": "# Padding\n\nPadding means \"space inside\" of something. This is why we had you change some background colors in this challenge. Without a background color it's hard to tell where the padding is. Of course you don't always want to show how wide or slim something is, so it's up to you whether or not you use padding with a background or without.\n\nPadding without a background color can be used just like margin to separate things, however, visual space created by padding is only visual space. The element with padding itself becomes wider. This can be very useful for things like menus and buttons, where you want something to have a large clickable area even if the element itself isn't very large on screen.\n# The Display Property\n\nThe `display` property is very important in CSS. It determines how HTML elements interact with each other on the page. For example, `<a>` tags have a default display property of `inline`, which means other components can ignore their vertical padding. However, `inline-block` means their padding cannot be ignored, and you will get the results you see in this challenge.\n\nSome important display properties:\n\n* `display: block;` This is the default for most elements \\(`div`, `p`, `h1`, etc\\) and puts things on their own line.\n* `display: inline-block;` This is useful when you want things to line up horizontally \\(`a` tags in a horizontal menu for example\\) and you also want to add margins or padding.\n* `display: flex;` This is useful when you want child elements to expand or contract to fit available space. This display property is super flexible, and you might find yourself using it all the time once you know it.\n\n\nThese display properties will make up most of your UI. The web app you're using right now was built with only these display properties."

You can customize this\\!\n\nThis is called a hover state, and you can style a hover state just like you can style any other CSS. The main difference is the selector.\n\n```css\n/* Style the hover state for all links on the site */\na:hover {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n/* Style just the nav links */\n.nav a:hover {\n  color: tomato;\n}\n\n/* Style the entire nav div when it's hovered */\n.nav:hover {\n  background: gray;\n}\n\n```\n\nTo style how something looks when the mouse hovers over it you use `:hover`. Specifically, you just put `:hover` after the selector you want to style. It's important not to put a space in front of `:hover`."

However there are certain aspects of CSS that are not intuitive. \n\nYou may be thinking \"None of this is intuitive\\! 😤\" and that's fair, but it gets better \\(worse?\\). In the next few challenges we'll dive into some of the more confusing _and_ useful CSS properties. You already saw some of this when we [talked about `box-sizing`](/workspace/nel5ggJ1), but there's yet more to cover. \n\nFun topics to come include:\n\n* Positioning \\(including the interesting `content` property\\)\n* More `display` property\n* Transforms\n\n# Why?\n\nSome of this stuff is bound to be fairly confusing at first and we take our content selection very seriously. So is it really that important? \n\n++Yes\\.++\n\nThe techniques we'll cover are extremely potent for creating _layouts_, which is the most confounding aspect of CSS. Almost everyone who has complained about any aspect of CSS ran into issues with their layout and spent entirely too long figuring out how to fix it. I would know, I've been that person—Everyone on the Pairwise team has in fact. \n\n> **Layouts vs Styling**\n> Layouts can be time consuming and frustrating to create when you don't know what you're doing. Styling, on the other hand, is quite straightforward. Things like `border` , `padding`, `font-size`, etc. To generalize:\n> \n> \n> \n>    * Styling refers to CSS that doesn't really care about _position_ on the page.\n>    * Layout is entirely concerned with position on the page. This includes vertical, horizontal, _and_ z\\-axis positioning—Layering things on top of  or behind one another.\n\nSo to bring it back to the question: Why are we learning these things? So that you can build any UI you want.\n\nWith a bit of practice ++you will be able to code up the CSS for Instagram, Twitter, Amazon, Etsy or your cat's blog++ \\(this last one sounds easy but you'd probably spend more time on it than any of the others. Try building anything for yourself as opposed to an employer or client and you will see why\\).\n\nSo let's move forward and learn some CSS\\!"

          "content": "# An introduction to positioning\n\nIn CSS the `position` property has a lot of power, but it's not necessarily clear how it works. There are three main positioning properties we're going to look at:\n\n* `position: relative;` That's what you were working with in this challenge.\n* `position: absolute;` More interesting than `relative` but you need them both together.\n* `position: fixed;` Very useful or annoying depending on your opinion. This is how websites \"fix\" a header or footer to the window as you scroll. If you've ever been on a cramped mobile site and the header would not leave you alone it's probably because of this CSS property.\n\n\nThere's also `position: static;`, which is the default for all elements. This means you won't see this property very often because it's always there unless you change it. Setting a `position` property on an element to **anything other than static** will make it \"positioned.\"\n\nAn element is considered \"positioned\" if it \n# What does this property let me do?\n\nIt lets you pick up an element and move it wherever you want relative to some other element.\n\nOnce you are using a position property you gain access to four new properties which let you control the location of an element on the page: `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```css\n.rel {\n    position: relative;\n    top: 20px;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis will visually move an element down by `20px`.\n\nThere are other challenges for `absolute` and `fixed` so let's talk about position `relative` first\\.\n# Relative to what?\n\nThis is one of those unintuitive properties in CSS. Relative positioning moves an element ++relative to itself++. That means, in the example above, the `.rel` element would be moved `20px` lower on the page than its initial position.\n# What does this let me do?\n\n* By far the most common use case of `position: relative;` is to set an element as an anchor for another element using `position: absolute;` \\(See [Position Absolute](/workspace/$TscTvcd)\\).\n* You can use relative positioning to \"nudge\" elements into the position you want.\n   * Sometimes your layout just won't cooperate. You can use relative positioning to cheat and force your element in a direction.\n   * I say \"nudge\" because if you're doing more significant repositioning you might want absolute positioning instead.\n\n# Relative and absolute\n\nI said we'd hold off on `position: absolute;` until another challenge but there's something we need to mention first: ++Absolute positioning and relative positioning need to work together to be effective++.\n\nWhen you use `positoin: absolute;` you are positioning an element _relative to the nearest parent element with_ `position: relative;`. \n\nIf that sounds confusing, don't worry—it is. It's best understood through examples and practice, so let's keep learning.\n# Resources\n\n* [Official documentation on relative positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Relative_positioning)\n\n"

In this example we positioned the `.label` elements in the upper\\-right of their parent elements.\n\nThe key is, the parent element has to have a position. Usually, this position is `position: relative;` because we don't want the parent to reposition itself, just serve as an anchor for the child element.\n\n> \n> ### The DOM Family Tree\n> \n> \\(if you're wondering what the DOM is, [here's a link to our that challenge](/workspace/C$3mo2yQ)\\)\n> \n> Programmers needed words to talk about the relationships between elements in the DOM and they understood that the DOM is a tree—much like a family tree. So when we talk about the DOM we use words you've heard many times before, but in a different context.\n> \n> **Parents:** When talking about the DOM we use the words \"parent\" or \"ancestor\" to refer to any element higher up in the tree.\n> **Siblings:** Any element at the same level in the tree. If you have three `a` tags inside a `div` the links are all siblings to each other. The `div` is their parent.\n> **Children: **Any element lower in the tree. Children are easy to identify in code because they are within another element.\n# DOM relationships and position absolute\n\nThe short version is: `position: absolute;` will position an element _relative to its nearest ancestor_ ++with a position++. Remember, for an element to be \"positioned\" it must have the position property set to either `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`.\n\nIf the element has no positioned ancestors then it will be relative to the `body` tag\\. This is what is happening in this challenge when you first load it up. You will see the `.label` elements displaying in the upper\\-right of_ the _`body` as opposed to their parent element.\n# A simple recipe\n\nLet's say you have two divs, `div.a` and `div.b`. If you want to display `div.a` relative to `div.b` do this:\n\n* Make sure `div.a` is inside `div.b`, in other words `div.b` is the parent of `div.a`.\n* Set `position: relative;` on `div.b` \\(The parent div\\).\n* Set `position: absolute;` on `div.a` \\(The child div\\).\n\n\nThen you can use the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right` properties to move `div.a` anywhere you want relative to `div.b`.\n# When would you use this?\n\n* You want to display a badge of some sort, like an unread count on an email app.\n   * You can see an example of this in this challenge.\n* You want some sort of custom border or edge to your element.\n   * You can see an example of this in the Pairwise navigation menu. Whenever you hover one of the challenge names it gets a \"border\" which is actually an absolutely positioned element, not a the `border` property\\.\n* When you want something to stretch to fit inside another element.\n   * This is a result of combinations of the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right` properties\\. We'll revisit this later.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Official Absolute Positioning Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Absolute_positioning)\n   * Just in case you're curious there are more examples in the official docs.\n\n"

There are several values you should be familiar with.\n\n```css\n.inline-block { display: inline-block; }\n.block { display: block; }\n.flex { display: flex; }\n.table { display: table; }\n\n```\n# Display Properties\n\nSetting `display` on an element let's you play around with how it interacts with other elements on the page. For example, `display: inline-block;` tells an element to flow \"in line\" with other inline elements but also to allow setting margins and padding. Setting `display: flex;` will tell an element reposition it's children in a row \\(or column\\).\n\nWe'll go through the key display properties one by one.\n\n## Inline Block\n\n```css\ndiv { display: inline-block; }\n\n```\n\nBy default many inline elements have unintuitive ways of handling margins and padding. It's often a good idea to apply  `display: inline-block;` to inline elements just so you don't bang your head against a wall for an hour trying to figure out why your `padding` isn't acting the way you expect.\n\n### Uses\n\n* You want to apply `margin` or `padding` to some inline element \\(`span` for example, or `a`\\).\n\n\n## Block\n\n```css\ndiv { display: block; }\n\n```\n\nThis is the default for most elements, so even if you want to make use of it you don't need to write it out explicitly. \n\n### Uses\n\n* Where display block can be more interesting is where you want an inline item to act like a block. Use `display: block;` on `a` tags to make a vertical nav menu.\n* Automatically size to take up all available width.\n\n\n## Flex\n\n```css\ndiv { display: flex; }\n\n```\n\n### Uses\n\n* Everything\\! \\(ok, not literally, but _almost_ everything\\).\n* Center items vertically, horizontally, or both.\n* Tell elements to take up \"Whatever space is left\" once other siblings are accounted for.\n* Space elements vertically or horizontally. You can justify them, clump them, put space between, etc.\n\n\nFlexbox is extremely \\_flex\\_ible, no pun intended \\(seriously\\). It's a workhorse for creating all sorts of layouts. If you're ever unsure how to get some layout you want, flexbox is often the answer.\n\nThat being said, there's a lot to learn and you won't use most of it very often. So focus on these properties:\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex; /* Of course */\n\n/* \n  You can control how elements grow or shrink to take advantage of space */\nflex: 1 100%;\n\n/* \n  Once you have a display: flex; on an element, use align-items and justify-content \n  to control how its children arrange themselves. */\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center; /* Also try: space-between, space-around, flex-end */\n\n```\n\n## Table\n\n```css\ndiv { display: table; }\n\n```\n\nIn all honesty you won't use this much. However, it does have one specific use case which you may find quite useful.\n\n### Uses\n\n* Tell an element to take up only as much spaces as needed, but otherwise behave like `block`.\n\n\nBy default any element with `display: block;` will stretch to be as wide as possible. You can assign a `width` property, `width: 500px;` for example, but that requires being specific about the width. What if you want to say \"Be as wide as you need to be, but no wider.\"? That's what display table lets you do."

This project demonstrates coding a UI that works well in that context.\n* Building layouts based on _constraints_ is a key skill and it's better to learn through doing.\n* If you can build a an interface like the one in this challenge you've reached a professional level. There is _much_ more covered in the course but even at this point if you've mastered this module you know enough that someone would pay you to create websites.\n\n\n## Why not build a mobile app?\n\nYou absolute _can_ build a mobile app if that suits your needs, and we'll be diving deep into mobile in the Mobile module. For now, the purpose of this challenge is to get you more experience using the CSS concepts covered in this module and to show you what it's like to build a more full UI rather than just a bit of challenge code.\n\nBuilding mobile apps is significantly move involved than building for the web, and will involve many concepts we haven't touched on yet at this point in the course including:\n\n* TypeScript\n* React\n* CLIs\n* Build Pipelines\n\n\nThe good news is that almost all of what you're learning now is transferrable to building mobile apps in some way.

Don't get me wrong—_most of the web_ is just text documents with the occasional image, but it's important to generalize the concepts your learning to more abstract ideas like a Tic Tac Toe board.\n\nFurthermore, we can use the tic tac toe board again later in the course to make it into a fully functional game that you can play with others or against the computer.\n\nAnd of course as always just by programming, getting more repetitions, you're building the neural pathways that will make all this stuff come as second nature to you over time.\n\n---\n\n\n> **There's almost always more than one solution**\n> \n> This challenge can be accomplished with `flex-wrap` and a fixed `width` or with a more conventional approach of three \"row\" divs and three `div`s inside them to serve as squares on the board.\n> \n> In fact there are many ways you could complete this challenge that I wouldn't even think of. That's part of the beauty of programming—there's always more than one way to get something done. It can also be a curse at times because other programmers will often do things in different ways than you would, but that's beside the point.\n"

We haven't learned enough TypeScript for that yet, so this challenge is all about HTML and CSS.\n\nYou can complete this challenge in the [Sandbox](/workspace/sandbox?type=markup). Once you're satisfied with the result export it to an HTML file. \n# Why?\n\nThere are two particularly important aspects to this project:\n\n* Get familiar with building applications, not just webpages\n* Turn a graphic design into a real interface you can use\n\n\n\n## Applications not web pages\n\nMany people think of HTML and CSS as tools to build web _pages_. That's certainly true, but that's not all you can do with HTML and CSS. You can also build web _applications_.\n\n> **Web applications vs web pages**\n> Possibly a silly distinction, but you will hear these terms in the wild so let's touch on this briefly. \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>    * A web page is just something you read. A news site, a product page, etc.\n>    * A web application is something you interact with. It's software. Web apps also include web pages. For example, Pairwise is a web _application_ \\(you can interact with it\\) but there are many parts of app that you just read, like this page here.\n\n## From design to product\n\nTaking a graphic design and turning it into a finished product is a very important skill because:\n\n* If you work for a company or a client they might give you designs that need to turn into apps.\n* If you want to build your own product you will have to design it and then create it, even if \"designing\" it just means visualizing it in your mind before coding.\n\n# Tips and hints\n\n* You can code in whatever order works best for you, but if you're not sure then start by writing some basic HTML then give it some basic styling. Maybe create the outline of the calculator and get the size and background color right. Then move on to the inner details and repeat.\n* If you're feeling stuck try starting over from the beginning.\n   * This may seem counterintuitive but sometimes you need a blank slate to get new ideas flowing, and there's not actually that much code to write in this challenge so actually typing things out won't take too long. _Thinking about what to write_ is where you will spend most of your time.\n* If you really get stuck or you feel this challenge needs some work let us know\\! There is a feedback button in the header.\n* If you're not sure how to type a `±` symbol or a `÷` symbol just copy and paste from here.\n   * These are Unicode symbols, so it's possible to type them on your computer. It's often a pain though so when in doubt just try Googling around for the relevant symbol. \n\n"

          "content": "Also known as deploying your first static site.\n\n> \n> ### Jargon Time\n> \n> **Deploy**: Taking whatever code you wrote and uploading it to a server where it can be accessed. For example, no one else can see the code you wrote during this module but if you _deploy_ your code then anyone can access it with the URL. This is very important for websites.\n> **Static**: As opposed to \"dynamic.\" In this context static means that your code is just a bunch of files that can be used directly without any additional software.\n# Deployment\n\nThis is the general term for \"putting something online.\" In fact it's even more general than that. Deployment can also mean putting your mobile app on an app store. It really just means putting your code where it needs to be.\n\n## Deploying a website\n\nIn the case of a website your code needs to be on a server where anyone can access it.\n\n**NOTE:** Even if you're creating a private website with a login page and a password it's still accessible to \"anyone\" in that anyone can visit your login page, even if they can't access the content locked inside.\n\n\n## Deploying a server\n\nLater in the course we'll be deploying more than just websites and the process will be different than what you saw in the video. Deploying servers is a bit more complicated than deploying static websites because:\n\n* Deploying a website just requires moving some files to a remote computer.\n* Deploying a server requires moving some files and then _running those files_ on a remote computer.\n\n\nThe latter is what \"Cloud computing\" often refers to, but it's just a buzz word. Every \"cloud\" and every \"server\" is just someone else's computer that you rent. \n\n![This fridge sticker speaks the truth!](/assets/8YMC6xUd/5ee6958730a2bfb33dab02cf62857115_someone-elses-computer.png)\n\n## Why is hosting free sometimes?\n\nThe short answer is it's extremely cheap \\(on a marginal basis\\) to provide static hosting. It's so cheap in fact that business can make good money by providing free hosting to many many people and charging just small percentage of them for more advanced or business\\-related features. The trick is, hosting providers can run their own software to host _your_ site, and by running their own software they server a huge amount of traffic while incurring minimal cost per view.\n\nHowever, hosting for servers is usually not free. This is because your server code is real software that has to run on a computer. However, the hosting provider does not control the software. In fact, they have no idea what software you're running. Your software could be tremendously resource intensive, requiring large amounts of computing power and electricity to run.\n\nAs a result the price of hosting servers usually ranges from extremely cheap to extremely expensive. It just depends on what your servers do and how much traffic they serve.\n\n> \n> ### Web Traffic \\(This is an aside, feel free to skip\\)\n> \n> It may not be obvious from the outside, but hosting a lot of traffic is no mean feat. Generally websites load pretty fast assuming you have a decent internet connection. For a small amount of traffic this is very easy to accomplish. If you have, say, 100 visitors every month that's no problem. The cheapest server you can rent can host that traffic with ease. You could even host that traffic from your own computer \\(although you shouldn't\\).\n> \n> Now, consider the extreme opposite: Facebook. A quick Google search told me they had 2.4 _billion_ users per month in 2018. That's roughly 1000 users _per second_ \\(nonstop, for every second of the year\\!\\). Having that many users connect to your servers every single second is decidedly **not easy, **and very expensive.\n> \n> Now consider less extreme example: Stripe, one of the most widely used payment platforms online. Stripe has many users but they deal in _transactions_. When their servers get a hit it's because someone is spending money, which happens considerably less frequently than people posting status updates and selfies to a social network. Their server costs are likely _much_ smaller than those of Facebook. \n> \n> The point is, the amount of money you might spend on a server depends entirely on the users you serve and the software you are running.\n> \n> Generally, hosting is very cheap and if you ever manage to get to 2.4 million users per month you'll have investors breaking down your door to throw money at you, so you can afford it.\n# Resources\n\n* That sweet sweet website deployed in the video: [https://meditative\\-tic\\-tac\\-toe.netlify.com/](https://meditative-tic-tac-toe.netlify.com/)\n* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n   * This is the hosting provider we used in the video. They have an online interface for managing your sites, which make them much more user friendly if you're just starting out your technical journey.\n* [Surge\\.sh](https://surge.sh/)\n   * Similar to Netlify in that they provide free hosting.\n   * You will need to use a command line interface to use Surge \\(at least last time I checked\\). This makes it much harder to use before you're familiar with a terminal.\n* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)\n   * Totally free. The others listed here have paid plans but as far as I know Github Pages doesn't even let you pay. There are probably some limits associated with that but I've never run into them.\n   * Github Pages is the hardest to get set up of all the options here, which doesn't mean it's necessarily difficult it just requires familiarity with two things we haven't covered yet \\(but we will later\\): The command line and Git.\n\n"

Fair enough, it's a pretty bad explanation. Let's try to make things clearer. Check out this nifty code:\n\n```markup\n<body>\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"divly\">\n      One nifty div\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      This is the same code from the lesson on <code>relative</code> positioning\n      in CSS. We're going to use it to talk about <strong>THE DOM!</strong>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n\n```\n\nLooking at this code you can see that at the top we have the `body`. Within that we have a `div.container`. Within that we have our nifty `div.divly` as well as a `p` tag\\. Within the `p` tag we have some other tags... etc etc.\n\nThe code above has a hierarchical structure. \n\n> The DOM is the general term we use for the tree, or hierarchy, of elements on a web page.\n\nIt's one of those industry terms that you simply never need to know until you start working web programming. So even if this seems obscure or irrelevant just bear with me. For now you'll have to take my word that having terms to talk about \"the elements of a webpage\" is useful.\n# The DOM defines relationships\n\nOnce again, the DOM is a hierarchy or a tree. Here are some examples if you're unfamiliar with the abstract idea of a tree.\n\n## Real\\-world Trees\n\nThink of a family tree. There are parents, siblings and children. If you think of your own lineage you can think of your parents, and their parents, and their parents...  all the way back to the dawn of the human race. This hierarchical relationship \\(parents, siblings, children\\) is a tree, which is why your family tree is called that.\n\nThink of a large company. At the top their's the CEO, then there are other C\\-level executives, below them there might be department heads, then regional or project managers, then employees \\(i.e. people who don't manage other people\\). This is also a tree, although the relationships might have different names: boss, peers, direct reports.\n\nYou can of course also think of a literal tree \\(trunk, branches, leaves\\) but the DOM is a bit more abstract so the former examples might be more useful.\n\n## DOM Relationships\n\nLet's take the example from above and define some relationships. \n\n* Starting with the `body` we would say it has one child: `.container` and is the document \"root\" meaning it has no parents—no other elements above it.\n* Moving on to the `.container` div we would say its parent is `body`, it has zero siblings and two children: `.divly` and a `p` tag\\.\n* `.divly` has `.container` as its parent, has one sibling \\(`p`\\) and no children.\n   * **NOTE**: There is text within the div, but for the purposes of this explanation we're focusing solely on HTML tags.\n\n\nGiven these examples you can probably work out how we would describe the `p` tag and its children.\n"

If you have inline styles that contradict your regular CSS styles the inline styles take precedence and will be applied.\n* You cannot reuse inline styles. You can certainly copy and paste your inline styles anywhere you want, but you can't reuse styles the way you can with CSS classes. \n   * If you decide you want to change some inline styles for your whole site you will have to make the change everywhere, rather than just in one place. \n* Inline styles are usually harder to read. If you just have one or two CSS properties it's no problem, but it quickly starts becoming difficult to read inline styles as they expand.\n\n# When is this useful?\n\nGiven the downsides mentioned above, why use this at all?\n\n* You really just want some styles on one element. This happens, and inline styles are great for it.\n\n\nThat's pretty much it. However, if you're using a UI framework \\(React, for example\\) rather than plain HTML inline styles can actually be very powerful, because the framework will give you other ways to write them. We'll revisit this in UI programming.\n"

          "content": "To explain what TypeScript is we first need to introduce JavaScript.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is the language of the web. It is a programming language invented in 1995 which runs in all web browsers. Traditionally, JavaScript _only_ ran in web browsers. More recently, it can run in non\\-browsers environments like servers, using NodeJS.\n\nJavaScript is a flexible, interpreted language with dynamic typing. Any modern web application you use \\(think Google drive/documents/slides, Netflix, YouTube, Facebook, etc.\\) is built primarily in JavaScript. JavaScript is a great programming language, but it was written in a short amount of time in the early days of the internet and it does leave many things desired.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nTypeScript is a \"typed superset' of JavaScript, which means it includes all of the features of JavaScript but adds some additional features on top. TypeScript is being developed by Microsoft and has existed since 2012. TypeScript is becoming widely adopted in the web development world, and is largely becoming the chosen language to write JavaScript applications. TypeScript is a \"compile to JavaScript\" language, meaning it \"compiles\" to JavaScript, which can then be run anywhere JavaScript can be run.\n\nWe have chosen to teach this introduction to software engineering course in TypeScript, rather than JavaScript. If you are interested in more of our rationale for this decision, feel free to [read it here](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum/).\n\n### Types\n\nThe primary distinguishing feature of TypeScript is the presence of \"types\" \\(hence the name\\). What this means is that any value in a TypeScript program has an associated \"type\" which the language compiler is aware of. This allows the compiler to understand, before the program can be run, whether or not some operations are \"safe\".\n\nConsider this valid JavaScript code which defines a function to say hello. You are probably expecting the function to receive a `name` variable which is a person's name like \"Sam\" or \"Sara\". But what if you give the function a number? This isn't a problem in JavaScript. It will just say \"Hello, 100\".\n\n```\nfunction sayHello(name) {\n    return \"Hello, \" + name;\n}\n\nsayHello(100);\n\n```\n\nBut in TypeScript results in the following an error:\n\n```typescript\n// We can give the function a type annotation to indicate\n// it only accepts string arguments.\nfunction sayHello(name: string): string {\n    return \"Hello, \" + name;\n}\n\n// This line result in the following error message:\n// Argument of type '100' is not assignable to parameter\n// of type 'string'.\nsayHello(100);\n\n```\n\nThe TypeScript compiler can tell you there is an error before you run the program, in fact, if you use a code editor with TypeScript support it can even tell you as you are writing the code\\!\n\nIn short, a typed language provides safeguards around defining programs which help you avoid bugs, errors, and mistakes as a program. TypeScript provides other useful features, which we will learn, but by and large the most powerful feature is the addition of type information.\n\nThe lack of types has plagued plain JavaScript programs with bugs for decades\\!\n\n### What This Means For You\n\nWe will be focusing on discussing TypeScript moving forward. However, it is helpful to remember that TypeScript includes all of the features JavaScript contains. We will discuss troubleshooting problems and searching for help online later, but for now suffice it to say if you are stuck or are interested in learning more about a topic it is perfectly valid to ask Google questions about JavaScript. The answers will be equally valid in TypeScript, and you may find more useful answers because JavaScript has existed for longer. For instance, consider these questions:\n\n* How do I define an array of items in JavaScript?\n* How do I define a function in JavaScript?\n* How do I iterate over all the keys and values in an object in JavaScript?\n\n\nThe solutions to these questions in JavaScript will apply in TypeScript as well. But remember, TypeScript includes some features JavaScript does not have, such as types. Therefore, if you are trying to find help for solving a TypeScript specific problem, you may want to include that in your search. For example:\n\n* How do I define an array type in TypeScript?\n* How do I define  a function which can accept generic type parameters in TypeScript?\n* How do I combine interface types in TypeScript?\n\n"

          "content": "Before we continue we go any further, we want to mention a few more details about TypeScript, and how TypeScript actual turns into code which can be run by a computer.\n\nTypeScript, and other \"compile to JavaScript\" languages, are compiled to JavaScript which can be run by web browsers or servers running NodeJS. This that the source and production versions of the code can in fact be very different. The source code includes features, syntax, and additional comments in the source language which may not be present in the compiled version which is actually run by the computer.\n\n### Source vs. Production Code\n\nIn general, you can think about programs in two forms: \"source\" code which is what software engineers read and write, and \"production\" code which is what computers read and execute. Typically, source code is formatted nicely and includes things like comments to describe the code organization or context. Production code often goes through many transformation steps before it is run by a computer. \n\nTypeScript, for instance, is compiled to JavaScript. Other languages may be compiled to machine code \\(binary\\). In additional, there may be other transformation steps, such as minification, stripping of dead code or comments, obfuscation/uglification and so on.\n\n### Production JS Bundle\n\nFor instance, take a look at this snippet from the production JavaScript bundle which is rendering the Pairwise platform you are looking at right now:\n\n```\n(this.deriveChallengeContextFromId = function(e) {\n  if (!n.challengeIdIsValid(e)) return null;\n  var t = Array.from(n.courseIdSet.values()).find(function(t) {\n      return n.challengeIdInCourseIsValid(t, e);\n    }),\n    r = n.courses.find(function(e) {\n      return e.id === t;\n    }),\n    o = !0,\n    i = !1,\n    a = void 0;\n  try {\n    for (\n      var s, l = r.modules[Symbol.iterator]();\n      !(o = (s = l.next()).done);\n      o = !0\n    ) {\n      var c = s.value,\n        d = !0,\n        p = !1,\n        u = void 0;\n      try {\n        for (\n          var h, g = c.challenges[Symbol.iterator]();\n          !(d = (h = g.next()).done);\n          d = !0\n        ) {\n          var m = h.value;\n          if (m.id === e)\n            return {\n              challenge: m,\n              module: { title: c.title, id: c.id, free: c.free },\n              course: { title: r.title, id: r.id }\n            };\n        }\n      } catch (y) {\n        (p = !0), (u = y);\n      } finally {\n        try {\n          d || null == g.return || g.return();\n        } finally {\n          if (p) throw u;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  } catch (y) {\n    (i = !0), (a = y);\n  } finally {\n    try {\n      o || null == l.return || l.return();\n    } finally {\n      if (i) throw a;\n    }\n  }\n}),\n\n```\n\nThis is not very readable\\! There are a lot of obscure, single\\-letter variable names and other bad practices. In addition, in the original form this is just one long string of text \\(it's nicely formatted above so you can read it more easily\\).\n\n### Original Source Code\n\nIn contrast, here is the original piece of code:\n\n```typescript\n// Provide the course context for a challenge, given its id\nderiveChallengeContextFromId = (challengeId: string) => {\n  // Short circuit if the challenge id is invalid\n  if (!this.challengeIdIsValid(challengeId)) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // Find the associated course id\n  const courseId = Array.from(this.courseIdSet.values()).find(id =>\n    this.challengeIdInCourseIsValid(id, challengeId),\n  );\n\n  // Find the associated course\n  const course = this.courses.find(({ id }) => id === courseId);\n\n  // Construct the challenge context from the course\n  for (const module of course.modules) {\n    for (const challenge of module.challenges) {\n      if (challenge.id === challengeId) {\n        return {\n          challenge,\n          module: {\n            title: module.title,\n            id: module.id,\n            free: module.free,\n          },\n          course: {\n            title: course.title,\n            id: course.id,\n          },\n        };\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n```\n\nThis is a lot more readable and clear\\!\n\nThe important thing to note is that a lot of transformation steps exist between the code that you write and the code that the computer executes.\n\n### An Interpreted Language\n\nJavaScript is an interpreted language, which means it is not compiled and instead executed by an interpreter which runs JavaScript and interprets into machine instructions as it runs. A compiled language like C or Rust is compiled into machine code which a computer can directly understand and run. Don't worry too much about this distinction right now, we will cover it more in depth in a Special Topics video lesson later.\n\nFor now, just be aware that the overall flow you should be familiar with is:\n\n* Source code is written in TypeScript, which includes types, comments, and special formatting.\n* TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript, and production code undergoes many transformation steps.\n* JavaScript engines execute JavaScript by interpreting it into executable instructions.\n\n"

These words are \"reserved\", meaning you cannot use them for other purposes. For instance, you cannot name a variable \"return\" or \"function\", since these words are keywords reserved for use by the language.\n\nHere is a longer \\(but not exhaustive\\) list of keywords:\n\n* `await`: used to \"await\" a promise value in the async/await construction\n* `break`: used to \"break\" from control statement blocks\n* `case`: used to define switch statement cases\n* `catch`: used for the try/catch construction\n* `const`: used to define constants\n* `continue`: used to \"continue\" in a control statement\n* `debugger`: used to pause program execution and call the debugger function\n* `else`: used in if/else conditional statements\n* `eval`: used to arbitrarily execute a string as code\n* `false`: a boolean keyword representing \"false\"\n* `finally`: used in the try/catch/finally construction\n* `function`: used to define functions\n* `if`: used for if/else conditional statements\n* `in`: used to evaluate if a key exists in an object\n* `new`: used to instantiate a new instance of a class\n* `null`: used to represent the \"null\" empty value\n* `return`: used to \"return\" a value from a function\n* `switch`: used in a switch statement construction\n* `throw`: used to throw an error from some block of code\n* `true`: a boolean keyword representing \"true\"\n* `try`: used in the try/catch construction\n* `typeof`: used to get the type of a value\n* `var`: used to define a variable\n* `while`: used to define a while loop construction\n* `yield`: used in generator constructions\n\n\nThis does not represent all of the language keywords, but just highlights many of the most common ones. It is also worth noting that there are some keywords which are reserved for future use in the language, but which currently do not have any actual usage.\n\nDo not worry about memorizing these\\! For now just understand the concept of keywords. You will get familiar with these as you write code in the upcoming challenges.\n"

Semicolons, `;`, are identifiers which indicate the end of a line.\n\n### An Example\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n```typescript\n\n\nconst name     = \"Sam\"   ;\n\n  function sayHello (person) {\n    // This is my function\n\n        if (person ) {\n          console.log(\"Hello \", person);\n        }   else    { return;\n\n        }\n  }\n\n\n\n  // Say hello!\nsayHello(   name) ;\n\n```\n\nThis code doesn't look that great... but it is actually valid and works fine\\!\n\nCompare that to the following:\n\n```\nconst name = \"Sam\";\n\nfunction sayHello(person) {\n  // This is my function\n\n  if (person) {\n    console.log(\"Hello \", person);\n  } else {\n    return;\n  }\n}\n\n// Say hello!\nsayHello(name);\n\n\n```\n\nThis is a much better formatted version of the above code snippet. The first code snippet has a lot of additional unnecessary whitespace and other weird indentations.\n\n### Code Style and Formatting\n\nMany modern programming languages include specific code style conventions and formatting tools which are used to format code in a specific way. This is very powerful, because if allows code style conventions to be consistent across teams and it doesn't require the programmer to ever spend any time formatting code manually.\n\nThe Pairwise workspace \\(and the developer workflow we will teach you later in the course\\) provide and use such formatting tools. We will see them in action in the next challenge\\!\n\n### Semicolons\n\nA short note about semicolons... Semicolons are used to mark the \"end\" of many statements in TypeScript, however they are not always strictly necessary. Without getting into the weird rules regarding semicolons, we would recommend trying to end statements using `;` and otherwise relying on the automatic formatting rules if you are in doubt.\n"

Even you may return to the same piece of code and need to remember what you were thinking when you first wrote it \\(trust us, one day this will happen and you will say to yourself: \"What was I thinking when I wrote this? Did I _even_ write this?\"\\)\\!\n\nSoftware products have constantly changing requirements and assumptions, and you will find often yourself revisiting code you thought \"could never change\". The important thing is to write code in the first place in a way which makes it easy to change in the future, when you find that requirements or assumptions have changed.\n\nWhen you are writing code here are just a few important rules to keep in mind:\n\n* **Readability:** how easy is it to read and follow the logic in a piece of code.\n* **Comments:** provide additional context or intention which is not clear from the code itself.\n* **Organization:** avoid complex structures, clever one\\-liners, and very nested if statements.\n* **Consistency:** use consistent style and formatting conventions.\n\n\nYou want to strive for code which is easy to read and understand by someone who is less familiar with the codebase, and easier to refactor and change in the future. This typically means code organized into many relatively small, single\\-purpose classes/functions which are easy to read and well documented/commented.\n\nStrong code design will be a theme throughout the course, so don't worry if this is not that clear yet. The main takeaway is that good software is not just about whether the code \"works\" or not. Well\\-written code not only works but is easy to understand and refactor in the future.\n\nCongratulations\\! You've now learned many important basic concepts for writing software. We can now dive in with some more practical skills."

          "content": "### Embrace Errors\n\nErrors are an unavoidable part of programming software.\n\nLearning how to handle failure conditions gracefully is one of the indispensable skills of a software developer.\n\nThis section should give you a basic idea about what errors are, what they mean for a computer program, and how to handle them. The `try/catch` construct is the basic paradigm for handling unsafe operations and is common to many programming languages.\n---\n\n### Errors and Stack Traces\n\nOne more thing to mention about errors is that they often provide a specific _message_ and _stack\\-trace_. The message is meant to tell you exactly what failed, e.g. `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'address' of null`.\n\nThe stack\\-trace shows you some information about \"where the program came from\" before it failed. It's like a trail of breadcrumbs, which show you how the program ended up at the place where it crashed. For instance, here is a full error message and stack trace for a real error:\n\n```typescript\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'address' of null\n at ApplicationContainer (ApplicationContainer.tsx:123)\n    at renderWithHooks (react-dom.development.js:16260)\n    at mountIndeterminateComponent (react-dom.development.js:18794)\n    at beginWork$1 (react-dom.development.js:20162)\n    at HTMLUnknownElement.callCallback (react-dom.development.js:336)\n    at Object.invokeGuardedCallbackDev (react-dom.development.js:385)\n    at invokeGuardedCallback (react-dom.development.js:440)\n    at beginWork$$1 (react-dom.development.js:25780)\n    at performUnitOfWork (react-dom.development.js:24695)\n    at workLoopSync (react-dom.development.js:24671)\n    at performSyncWorkOnRoot (react-dom.development.js:24270)\n    at scheduleUpdateOnFiber (react-dom.development.js:23698)\n    at updateContainer (react-dom.development.js:27103)\n    at react-dom.development.js:27528\n    at unbatchedUpdates (react-dom.development.js:24433)\n    at legacyRenderSubtreeIntoContainer (react-dom.development.js:27527)\n    at Object.render (react-dom.development.js:27608)\n    at Module../src/index.tsx (index.tsx:27)\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:790)\n    at fn (bootstrap:150)\n    at Object.1 (utils.ts:523)\n    at __webpack_require__ (bootstrap:790)\n    at checkDeferredModules (bootstrap:45)\n    at Array.webpackJsonpCallback [as push] (bootstrap:32)\n    at main.chunk.js:1\n\n```\n\nThe numbers at the end of each line are line numbers in the original source code. Specifically, the list of lines are a list of function calls. The function calls of a program are piled up in a stack as a program executes, and resources allocated for handling function execution are only removed once the function _returns\\._ A stack trace is just a trace of all the function calls which led to the present place where the program failed.\n\nThe purpose of a stack\\-trace is to help the programmer track down exactly where the program got into a failure state, so it is easier to fix.\n\nStack\\-traces are scary, but they are meant to help you\\!\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIdeally, you want your programs to be error\\-free. However, you will find that is almost impossible. You will always be surprised at the strange ways computer programs can fail. What you should strive for is to write code in which it is easy and fast to understand how and why errors occurred, when they do, and easy to refactor your code to fix errors when you need to. Instead of trying to write perfect code you should try to write and think about code which can be very easy to adapt to handle errors when errors occur.\n\nNow that you know about how to log information from your program with the `console`, handle, throw, and catch errors, and read stack\\-traces you are well on your way to dealing with errors which will occur as you write your first programs\\!"

          "content": "Central to every TypeScript program is the data that it concerns, operates on, and manipulates. But what exactly is that data? How can it be described, and what are its properties?\n\nWell, TypeScript, like every programming language, has different _types_ of data. The number of types that can be created by a programming language’s users is infinite, however all languages, including TypeScript, have a set of built\\-in types, the lowest level of which are called **primitives**. These types can be operated on and manipulated by themselves, or be composed with other types to form more complex types, but this is a topic we’ll cover in more detail later. For now, let’s focus on TypeScript's most common **primitive data types**.\n\nFirst, though, let’s clear something up. \n\n## What exactly is a type?\n\nAt its most basic, a type describes a particular piece of data. A piece of data’s type lets us \\(and more importantly, the TypeScript compiler\\!\\) know how this particular piece of data can be used and what kind of operations can be performed on it. For example, something with the type `number`, should be able to be added, subtracted, divided, and multiplied with other pieces of data that also have the type `number`. Makes sense, right\\!?\n\nIn fact, you just learned your first type: `number`\\! As you might have guessed, this is one of TypeScript's primitive data types; one of the basic building blocks of the data found within a TypeScript program.\n\n> **Tip**\n> A compiler is responsible for translating code written in one programming language into another language. In many cases, compilers are responsible for translating human\\-readable source code into something called machine\\-code, which is highly optimized and only intended to be interpreted by computers. In the case of TypeScript, the compiler is responsible for translating TypeScript into JavaScript that can be executed anywhere JavaScript can be.\n\n## TypeScript Primitive Types\n\nTypeScript supports several primitive data types, including:\n\n* `number`\n* `string`\n* `boolean`\n* `null`\n* `undefined`\n\n\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, for the purpose of the next several lessons, these are the types you'll need to know. Let's take a closer look at each one in the next few challenges."

In TypeScript, _`number`_ refers to the data type, while `Number` refers to the  __global__, and more concrete, `Number` object, a concept that goes beyond the scope of this lesson. For now, it's just important that you understand the distinction, and that TypeScript is a case\\-sensitive programming language. While this may seem like a small difference, remember: in the case of `number` vs\\. `Number`, case matters\\!\n\n## Just one number\n\nIn the challenge above, we discussed that data with the type `number` in TypeScript can represent both whole and fractional values. While it is not important in the context of this course, you might find it interesting to know that commonly, in other program languages, fractional values, or _floating point_ values, are represented by another data type. TypeScript is unique in that all numbers are considered floating point values."

This is the only type we've learned about so far which is not a valid type in TypeScript's subset language, JavaScript. This is because `any` is _just a type_,\\_ \\_and JavaScript is not a statically typed language like its superset, TypeScript.\n\nIn other words, `any` cannot be expressed literally. It is not a primitive type, and has no actual value that corresponds to it, the way that integer literals can be assigned to the `number` type, and string literals can be assigned to `string`. Rather, _all values_ can be assigned to `any`. \n\n```typescript\nconst quux: any = \"foo bar baz\";\nconst quuz: any = 70000;\nconst corg: any = true;\nconst flob: any = undefined;\nconst glob: any = null;\n\n```\n\n`any` is sort of like a type check escape hatch. It basically lets TypeScript know _not_ to **type check** something at compile\\-time \\(before the code is executed, i.e. statically\\).\n\n> **Tip**\n> Type checking is the process of validating and enforcing the type constraints in our code. Static type checking \\(such as in TypeScript\\), happens at compile\\-time, and helps to greatly reduce the occurrence of run\\-time errors in our code.\n\nUsing `any` can be extremely useful when we simply don't know the type of data something will be until run\\-time \\(when the code is actually executed\\). This might be because the data is coming from some external source that we don't have knowledge of beforehand, such as a program's end\\-user, or an external library. \n\nThat said, it is generally considered best practice to avoid using `any` wherever possible. This is because `any` makes our code less _type safe_: anything labeled as `any` will be type checked only at run\\-time \\(i.e. dynamically\\) and if there's a type mismatch, an error will be thrown, and your users' experience may impacted. \n\n> If `any` is overused, many of the benefits of using a statically typed language will be lost, and the incidence of run\\-time errors \\(something we always want to avoid\\!\\) is likely to increase. \n\nThe takeaway: use `any` sparingly, only when it is absolutely necessary."

Variables store _references_ to data, or _values_, which we can use in our programs. Here, `foo`  is of the type `number` and has a value of `100`.  `100` is stored in memory, but the variable `foo` holds a reference to that memory, so it can be called up again and again, and used throughout the program. This is an important concept:\n\n> Variables store references to values stored in memory, and do not store the values themselves.\n\nIn TypeScript, to give meaning to a variable, it must be _declared_, _initialized_, and _assigned_ a value. Let's break this down.\n\n## Declaration & Initialization\n\nThroughout the next several lessons, we'll primarily be using they keywords `let`  and `const` to declare our variables. Each of these keywords has a slightly different behavior, which we'll explore in more detail later.\n\nThe syntax for variable declaration requires one of these keywords and an identifier, or name, to act as the variable's unique identifier.  When we declare a variable, it is automatically _initialized_, and memory is allocated for it. Once initialized, a variable will be `undefined` until we assign a value to it. \n\n```typescript\nlet baz; // baz is undefined\n\n```\n\n## Assignment\n\nThat's where the `=` operator comes in. Assignment is pretty intuitive: to the left of the `=` is the variable that we're assigning a value to \\(the left operand\\), and to the right of it is the value that we're assigning \\(the right operand\\).  In other words, the assignment operator gives the value of its right operand to its left operand. That's it\\!\n\nA variable can be declared and initialized first, and assigned a value later in the program. \n\n```typescript\nlet baz; // baz has been declared and intialized, and is undefined\n// do something...\nbaz = \"a string\"; // baz has been assigned a value\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, a variable can be declared, initialized, and given a value in a single statement.\n\n```typescript\nconst bar = \"cool!\"; // bar has been declared, initialized, and assigned a value\n\n```\n\nA quick note here: the process of assigning a variable a value for the first time \\(as in the above example\\) is also sometimes referred to as \"initialization\", since we're \"initializing\" the variable with a value. However, from a theoretical standpoint, true \"initialization\" happens when the variable is declared and the JavaScript engine \\(which ultimately runs all of our TypeScript code, since TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript before execution\\) allocates memory for it.\n\nWe're going to dive deeper into variables and assignment in the next few lessons.\n\nLet's go\\!"

In other words, if you assign the string `\"immutable\"` to a variable declared with `const`, you can always count on that variable being equal to the string `\"immutable\"`. Likewise, if you assign it a number, a boolean, null, or undefined. These types are immutable by nature, and values of these types cannot change over time \\(if a string or number appears to change over time, it is really a new instance of a string or number\\).\n\nFor more complex data types, though, `const` can trip you up if you're not careful. Check out the following examples using arrays:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // error! arr cannot be reassigned\n\n```\n\nLike you would expect, you cannot assign `arr` a new array \\(or any other value\\). However:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr.push(4);\n// here, .push(4) adds the number 4 to the end of the list\n// the list now equals [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n```\n\nAlthough we didn't assign `arr` a new value, its current value is different than the value we originally assigned to it. More precisely, the array that `arr` references has been _mutated_.\n\nWe will explore the concept of immutability more in future lessons, but for now, you should be aware that `const` only ensures that a variable cannot be reassigned, _not_ that the value it references is immutable."

          "content": "## The Increment Operator\n\nThere are a couple of nuances to note about the increment operator. The increment operator can be used either _prefix_ or _postfix_, meaning either _before_, or _after_, its operand.\n\n```typescript\nlet a = 3;\nlet b = 3;\nlet c = ++a; // prefix usage\nlet d = b++; // postfix usage\n\n```\n\nWhile these expression look similar, their behavior is slightly different. The prefix operator increments its operand and returns its value _after being incremented_, while the postfix operator increments its operand and returns its value _before being incremented_. Let's take a look again with some results:\n\n```typescript\nlet a = 3;\nlet b = 3;\nlet c = ++a; // c = 4 prefix returned a after being incremented\nlet d = b++; // d = 3 postfix returned b before being incremented\n// a = 4, b = 4 both a and b were incremented\n\n```\n\n\n## The Decrement Operator\n\nSimilar to the increment operator, is the decrement, or `--` operator\\. It's a unary operator that behaves much the same way as the `++` operator, except that it decrements its numeric operand, rather than increments it. \n\n```\nlet x = 100;\nx--; // x = 99\n\n```\n\nLike the increment operator, `--` can only be used on variables declared with `let`. It also has identical prefix and postfix behaviors \\(if used prefix, it returns the value of its operand after being decremented, and vice versa if used postfix\\).\n\n```\nlet x = 100;\nlet q = 100;\nlet y = --x; // y = 99, x = 99\nlet z = q--; // z = 100, q = 99\n\n```\n\nWe're not going to cover this operator in a separate lesson, because its behavior is so similar to what we've covered here.

Its only purpose is to convert its operand to a number \\(if it isn't one already\\) and return the result. Note that the operand itself _is not_ affected\\.\n\n```\nconst fiveAsString = \"5\";\nconst fiveAsNumber = +fiveAsString;\n// fiveAsString = \"5\", fiveAsNumber = 5\n\n```\n\nTry this out in the [sandbox](/workspace/sandbox) on more complex string representations of numbers \\(e.g. `\"-23543.0274\"`\\), and on values other than strings and see what you get\\! For instance, what do you expect the result to be when you use the unary plus operator on booleans or on `null`?\n\n```\nconst isTrue = true;\n+isTrue // ??\n\n```\n\nExperimentation and fun aside, It should be noted here, however, that there are other, more preferred ways to convert values to numbers in TypeScript. The unary plus operator is borderline esoteric, but will work just fine for simple use\\-cases. For more complex cases, other methods are preferred:\n\n```\nconst notReallyPi = \"3.14IsPie...err...ImeanPi\";\nconst definitelyNotPi = +notReallyPi; // NaN (not a number)\nconst pi = parseFloat(notReallyPi); // 3.14\n\n```\n\nThis example is obviously contrived, but you get the picture.\n\n## The Unary Negation Operator\n\nThe unary negation, or `-`, operator negates the value of its operand. If its operand is not a number, it also converts it to a number before negating it.\n\n```\nconst threeAsNumber = 3;\nconst threeAsString = \"3\";\n-threeAsString; // -3\n-threeAsNumber; // -3\n\n```\n"

          "content": "### Control Statements\n\nThere are two major types of control statements in programming: conditional statements and loops. We will cover conditional statements first, and then loops. Control statements are just statements that determine if other blocks of code will be execute or not. They are one of the fundamental building blocks for building software with more complex behavior.\n\n### Conditional Statements\n\nYou are definitely familiar with conditional statements from everyday life: they are basically statements which take the form:\n\n> _If_ it is raining, _then_ I should wear a coat and take an umbrella.\n\nConditional statements are just a way of making decisions based on conditions which can be true or false.\n\n### The if/else Construction\n\nConditional statements in TypeScript \\(and many other languages\\) are constructed using the keywords `if`, `else`, and `else if`. For instance:\n\n```\nif (isRaining) {\n    // Handle rainy weather\n} else if (isSunny) {\n    // Handle sunny weather\n} else {\n    // Handle other weather conditions\n}\n\n```\n\nTo construct a conditional statement you must start with the `if` keyword and then add a _condition_ in parentheses. The _condition_ will determine whether the statement in the `{ ... }` should run or not. If not, the program will proceed to evaluate the next condition, if one exists.\n\nIf/else statements can only result in the execution of a single statement. For example, in the above example, if `isRaining` is `false` but `isSunny` is `true`, then the code in the `isSunny` block will run and then the computer will continue outside of the if/else construction. It will never visit the `else` block, because it has already found a matching condition.\n\nIf/else statements are a very simple way to program decision making into software and probably the most common. If/else statements are not the only way to write conditional statements, however. Other options include switch statements and ternary expressions.\n\n### Ternary Expressions\n\nA ternary expression is a shorthand way for writing an if/else statement. Consider a value which can have two states, like `isLoggedIn` which can be `true|false`. The following code is equivalent:\n\n```\n// Using an if/else statement\nfunction getUserAccount(isLoggedIn: boolean) {\n    if (isLoggedIn) {\n        return UserAccount;\n    else {\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\n// Using a ternary expression\nfunction getUserAccount(isLoggedIn: boolean) {\n    return isLoggedIn ? UserAccount : null;\n}\n\n```\n\nA ternary expression collapses an if/else statement into the `condition ? ... : ...` shorthand\\. This syntax may look a little strange, but it is just saying: _if_ the condition is true `?` then do this, _else_ `:` do that. The ternary is a common structure in many languages, and can be a useful way for writing if/else logic in a short and concise manner. \n\nHowever, a word of caution: be careful not to abuse using ternary expressions\\! It is easy to write complex if/else logic using ternaries which later becomes very hard to read or understand.\n\n### Switch Statements\n\nSwitch statements also allow you to write if/else logic, however, they are specifically useful for handling multiple states for a single value. For example, consider the weather example above and imagine we are building an app which shows a different display based on the current weather conditions. Our weather type is defined like this:\n\n```typescript\ntype WEATHER = \"SUNNY\" | \"RAINY\" | \"SNOWY\" | \"CLOUDY\";\n\n```\n\nWe can then write a switch statement to \"switch\" over the different options the weather can be in order to handle each \"case\" separately. Here is the code:\n\n```\nfunction handleWeatherConditions(weather: WEATHER) {\n    switch (weather) {\n        case \"SUNNY\":\n            // Handle sunny weather\n            break;\n        case \"SUNNY\":\n            // Handle sunny weather\n            break;\n        case \"SUNNY\":\n            // Handle sunny weather\n            break;\n        case \"SUNNY\":\n            // Handle sunny weather\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Handle fall through case\n            break;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can see this is a very structured way for handling different variations of a value. A few things to note about switch statements:\n\n* Switch statements are defined using the `switch` keyword, which then must specify the value to \"switch\" over in parentheses.\n* Each \"case\" in a switch statement is defined using the `case` statement and then the value it which should match that case.\n* You must `break` or `return`from a case once you handle a condition, unless you want the switch statement to continue checking other cases. This behavior differs from normal if/else statements.\n* You can use a `default` block to handle fall through values. This is like the finally `else` statement in an if/else construction.\n\n\n### Conditionals in Action\n\nThink about some software you commonly use and imagine the many decisions the software must make as you are using it. All of these decisions are encoded using if/else statements, switch statements, and ternary expressions. These are the basic building blocks for building complex software which can handle many different states and behaviors.\n\nThere are no pre\\-defined ways for you to mix and combine these conditional statements. You can nest them together, or combine them, in any way you want. You can have an if/else statement with a switch statement inside the `if` block, and some ternary expressions in there. The code might not be very readable, but there is nothing to prevent you from doing that\\!\n\nNow, let's get some practice working with conditional statements\\!"

When you have to do the same thing, over and over again, it can feel really tedious. Well, if you've ever thought to yourself \"There must be a better way\\! 😫\" then you're already thinking like a programmer.\n\nUnfortunately, at the time of this writing there's not yet an affordable robot that can fold your clothes \\(if you know of one, please tell me\\!\\). However, there _is_ a way to quickly send event invites to people. It's called adding a bunch of recipients to the same email. Imagine if you had to actually send each email 1\\-by\\-1.\n\nThe point is, if it's digital ++you can find a way to make a computer do repetitive tasks for you++. That's what we're going to talk about in this section: Telling a computer to do the same thing over and over and over again... until it's done \\(or maybe even forever\\).\n\n> \n> ### Story Time \\(feel free to skip this completely\\)\n> \n> Back in college, before I knew how to program _at all_, I had a job working at our IT department. It was a pretty sweet gig: The hours were easy, the pay was decent \\(for an on\\-campus job\\), and my coworkers were great. It was even a job I could claim gave me technical skills on a resume \\(hah\\!\\). There was just one problem...\n> \n> **The job was extremely tedious.**\n> \n> One of my core responsibilities on the job was renaming and reorganizing video files that were uploaded by professors through some obscure campus portal software. These videos would find their way into a shared network drive where I could then access them using my super admin powers. \n> \n> This was very easy. I would open the upload folder for a professor and rename each file to include the current date, the professors user id, and the original name of the file. However, as I mentioned earlier, _this was \\__**super** tedious\\. \\_So, like any future programmer I thought to myself \"There must be a better way\\! 😫\" and then proceeded to do nothing about it for a whole week.\n> \n> After a week though, I had had enough and I set out on a Google\\-searching mission that eventually lead me to loops\\! Well, loops and a bunch of cobbled together code that semi\\-sort\\-of automated some of my tedious task using shell scripts \\(a topic we'll cover another time\\). The point is my job became much more enjoyable because I learned about looping. \n# Looping\n\nLooping is conceptually simple—it's telling a computer to do the same thing repeatedly until some condition is met. Let's jump in with an example:\n\n```\nhey\n\n```\n# Why looping is important\n\n"

The function can be used like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst FIVE = addTwoNumbers(2, 3);\nconst TEN = addTwoNumbers(2, 8);\nconst ONE_HUNDRED = addTwoNumbers(50, 50);\n\n```\n\nYou can use functions to write specific, reusable instructions in one place, and then use them throughout your entire program. This allows you to encapsulate code which serves a specific purpose in a single location. This is important for code reuse \\(DRY: \"don't repeat yourself\"\\), code organization, code readability, and code testability.\n\nAs you build more complex programs, you will write more complex functions which call other functions, or functions which are composed of a series of smaller functions. Functions are the fundamental building block for building software applications. Eventually, you can conceptualize an entire application or program just as a function, or collection of functions.\n\nAll software is just data and operations or transformations of that data. Functions are what all you to perform these transformations.\n\nIn this section, we will get a lot of experience writing functions in TypeScript. Let's dive in\\!"

This helps to improve the organization and readability of your program, and it may prevent bugs and problems as well.\n\nHowever, scope is not the only tool a programmer has to accomplish a goal like this.\n\nLater on, you will learn how to write programs and build apps using a real code environment \\(not this fun editor playground in a browser\\!\\). When you reach that stage, you will have a lot of other tools at your disposal.\n\nFor example, you can define parts of your program in different files, put related files in different folders, and then _import_ values from one file into another. You can also control what you _import_ and _export_. This is a very powerful capability for organizing software programs. These same skills will also allow you to download open source code other people have written and import this code in your own projects as well\\! This is incredibly useful and opens the doors to building a number of interesting applications\\!\n\nYou will learn the details of this later, but for now just keep it in mind as a short preview and extension of the ideas of scopes which will come in handy later\\!\n\nTake a look at this code snippet for a short teaser:\n\n```typescript\n// This imports the library \"request\", which is open source and written\n// and maintained by other developers.\nimport request from \"request\";\n\n// The request library lets you make HTTP requests to URLs!\nrequest(\"http://www.google.com\", (error, response, body) => {\n  if (error) {\n    throw error;\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"Success!, Response received: \", body);\n    // Do somethine else here...\n  }\n});\n\n```\n"

          "content": "A bunch of values together in a bucket.\n\nCollections is a general term. When we talk about collections we're going to be talking about two data structures in TypeScript:\n\n* Arrays\n   * A list of things. Like a shopping list. \n   * You access things within the array using an index. Example: `myArray[2]`\n* Objects\n   * A group of things, usually related. Like a row in a spreadsheet.\n   * You access things using a property name, which is a string. Example: `myObject[\"name\"]`\n   * You can **also** access things using a dot, followed by the property name. Example: `myObject.name`\n      * This is more common, but only works if your property name doesn't have special symbols like hyphens.\n\n# The importance of collections\n\nCollections are yet another way of representing data. You've seen `string`, `number`, `boolean` but alone those types are insufficient to represent the data of the world. In order to represent real\\-world data we're going to need collections.\n\n## Why arrays are important\n\nList are _everywhere_. You may not have thought about it before, but there are list all over the place. It's wild\\!\n\n* This page is made up of a list of html tags like `p`, `h1`, etc. The text within those tags is also a list, a list of characters like `a`, `b`, `c`, `.`, etc.\n* Schools have lists of students and grades.\n* Companies have lists of employees, expenses, and customers.\n* If you wrote out everything you did today it would make a list.\n* A recipe contains a lists of ingredients and steps to complete a dish.\n* The contacts in your phone is a list.\n\n\nThe list goes on \\(pun very much intended\\). The point is if we want to represent any of these things digitally we need the concept of a list in our programs. In TypeScript this takes the form of the `Array`.\n\n## Why objects are important\n\nThe idea of an object is a \"thing\" that has properties. For example, you—being a person—probably have a name, a job, and a _list_ of favorite HTML colors:\n\n```typescript\nconst me = {\n  name: \"Ian\",\n  job: \"Building Pairwise\",\n  favoriteHTMLColors: [\"Salmon\", \"Tomato\", \"Lime\"],\n};\n\n```\n\nYou see what I did there? An object con contain a list and likewise a list can also contain an object. TypeScript is very flexible like this.\n\n```typescript\nconst people = [\n  {\n    name: \"Ian\",\n    job: \"Building Pairwise\",\n    favoriteHTMLColors: [\"Salmon\", \"Tomato\", \"Lime\"]\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Sean\",\n    job: \"Building Pairwise\",\n    favoriteHTMLColors: [\"SeaShell\", \"Coral\", \"MediumSeaGreen\"]\n  }\n];\n\n```\n\\(Sean doesn't yet know he favors the \"beach theme\" of HTML colors 🤫\\)\n\nAnother way to visualize the data above in the `people` array is as a table. Consider this more familiar form: \n| **Name** | **Job** | **Favorite HTML Colors** |\n|:--- |:--- |:--- |\n| Ian | Building Pairwise | Salmon, Tomato, Lime |\n| Sean | Building Pairwise | SeaShell, Coral, MediumSeaGreen |\n\nLook at that\\! By adding arrays and objects to our arsenal we can suddenly represent tabular data, which means we can represent anything you can put into a spreadsheet \\(quite literally, just look at Google Sheets\\).\n\nWe can even build on top of objects and arrays to create new data structures. \n# Syntax\n\nOK, now that we  know _why_ let's talk about _how_. The syntax for arrays and objects is fairly simple, but it may not be intuitive.\n\n## Creating Arrays and Objects\n\n```typescript\nconst htmlColors = [\"Salmon\", \"Tomato\", \"Lime\"];\nconst cat = {\n  name: \"Maomi\",\n  job: \"Napping\",\n  favoriteHTMLColors: [\"LightSalmon\", \"Salmon\", \"DarkSalmon\"] // Yes, these are real colors\n};\n\n```\n\nWe've created a new array with three wonderful HTML color names inside it and we've created a new `cat` object with some cat\\-appropriate properties.\n\n> **Syntax Specifics**\n> To create an array place any valid values separated by `,`within `[` and `]`\n> To create an object\n> \n> \n>    * Open `{` and `}` brackets\n>    * With the brackets use a string, followed by `:` , followed by any valid value to create a key\\-value pair\n\n## Using Arrays and Objects\n\n```typescript\nconsole.log(htmlColors[1]); // => \"Tomato\"\nconsole.log(cat.job); // \"Napping\"\nconsole.log(cat.favoriteHTMLColors[0]); // \"LightSalmon\"\n\n```\n\nHere we log three things out to the console.\n\n1. Log the string at index `1` of the `htmlColors` array\\.\n1. Log the value associated with the key `job` on the `cat` object\\.\n1. Log the string at index `0` of the array at key `favoriteHTMLColors` on the `cat` object\\.\n\n\nThe third line is an example of using nested selectors. \n\n> **Syntax Specifics**\n> To access an element within an array use a number placed between `[` and `]` after the array\n> To access a value associated with a key on an object place the key after a the object and a `.`\n> Alternatively, objects can use the same syntax as arrays except rather than a number use a string: `console.log(cat[\"name\"]);`\n"

          "content": "Replacing text is all about transforming one string into another string. Some really common uses for text replacement are:\n\n* Remove unwanted characters from a string. In other words, replacing unwanted characters with an empty string.\n* \"Escape\" characters in a string to make it viable as a URL \\(Ever wonder why URLs don't have spaces in them?\\)\n* Turn plain text URLs into `a` tags so they can be clicked. For example: `http://example.com` can be replaced with `<a href=\"http://example.com>http://example.com</a>` and it will become clickable in a browser.\n\n# Replacing text is unintuitive\n\nUnfortunately, text replacement might not work as you expect. Consider this example:\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(\" \", \"_\"); // => ???\n\n```\n\nWhat would you expect this to return? Intuitively you might expect all spaces to be replaced by underscores \\(\"\\_\"\\) but that's not the case. Only the fist space will get replaced:\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(\" \", \"_\"); // => \"hello_fellow learners\"\n\n```\n\nHm\\... 🤔 This might be what you want but usually it's more useful to replace _every_ occurrence of a string. In this case what we want is `\"hello_fellow_learners\"`. In order to get that we need to use regular expressions—regex for short. Let's look at how we would make the previous example replace _all spaces_ with underscore.\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(/ /g, \"_\"); // => \"hello_fellow_learners\"\n\n```\n# Using Regex for String Replacement\n\nThe `replace` function can work with just a string as the first argument, but if you want to do more advanced replacements or even simply replace all occurrences of a string you will need to use regex.\n\n\n## Replacing All Occurrences\n\nThe key to replacing all matched strings is to use a global regex, namely the `g` flag\\.\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(/ /g, \"_\"); // => \"hello_fellow_learners\"\n\n```\n\nLet's look at that example from above again. Take note of the `g` directly after the regex matching the space character \\(`/ /`\\). That `g` flat informs the `replace` function that we want to replace _globally_ rather than just the first occurrence.\n\nIf we were to leave out the `g` flat we would get the same result as when we used a string.\n\n```typescript\n\"hello fellow learners\".replace(/ /, \"_\"); // => \"hello_fellow learners\"\n\n```\n# Getting the Right Regex\n\nConsidering how obscure regex syntax can be, we recommend using a tool to build up regex unless you're already familiar with the replacement you want to do. In the starter code for this challenge we used the regex `/\\./g` to replace all periods in a string. You can find an interactive example of that regex [here](https://regex101.com/r/9y1K7w/1).\n\n## Use Regex 101\n\nIn general, we recommend that whenever you're unsure of a regex you use an online tool for visualizing the results of your regex. At present we recommend Regex 101.\n\n* [Regex101\\.com](https://regex101.com/r/9y1K7w/1)\n\n"

Consider this list of todos:\n\n```\nconst todos = [\n  { title: \"Buy soymilk\", completed: true },\n  { title: \"Write finding indices challenge\", completed: false },\n  { title: \"Bake cookies\", completed: true },\n];\n\n```\n\nThis list could serve as the data behind a simple todo app. Now imagine you have such an app and you click a checkbox to complete the middle item `\"Write finding indices challenge\"`. Before you click the app might look like this:\n\n![](/assets/yOKFRV46u/14d3762625a2d63ead4bb83896bf3cea_todo.png)\nOnce you click the todo item to complete it you will want to update the array to reflect that. If we know the index it's quite simple, if relatively verbose:\n\n```\nlet todos = [\n  { title: \"Buy soymilk\", completed: true },\n  { title: \"Write finding indices challenge\", completed: false },\n  { title: \"Bake cookies\", completed: true },\n];\n\n// Before\nconsole.log(todos[index].completed); // false\n\nconst index = /* ??? */;\n\ntodos = [\n  ...todos.slice(0, index),\n  {\n    ...todos[index],\n    completed: true,\n  },\n  ...todos.slice(index + 1),\n];\n\n// After\nconsole.log(todos[index].completed); // true \n\n```\n\nIn this case the index would be `1`, which you can tell just by looking at the tiny array, but what if we have 200 todos or 2000? It becomes necessary to find the index without having to look at it with our human eyes. We need the computer to find it for us.\n# indexOf \n\nTaking a step back from the todos example, let's consider a simple list of numbers:\n\n```typescript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 256];\n\n```\n\nWhat's the index of `256`? Again you can tell just by looking at the array for a second but we want the computer to tell us. To do this we can use the `indexOf` function\\.\n\n```typescript\nnumbers.indexOf(256); // => 6\n\n```\n\nGreat\\! But we can pass anything into `indexOf`, what if we ask for something that doesn't exist in the array?\n\n```typescript\nnumbers.indexOf(8); // => -1\n\n```\n\n`-1` what's going on there 🤔?\n\n## Why indexOf can return \\-1\n\nThe reason for this oddity si that `-1` is an invalid index. So by returning an invalid index `indexOf` is telling us that there is no `8` in the array.\n# findIndex\n\n`indexOf` is great for finding a specific thing when you know exactly what that thing is. Finding `256` was easy because we knew exactly what we were looking for and we could tell the computer. However, sometimes you need to find items based on criteria rather than a specific value. There is a function just for this called `findIndex`.\n\nThis brings us back to the todo list example. We can fill in the question marks from earlier with `findIndex`:\n\n```typescript\nlet todos = [\n  { title: \"Buy soymilk\", completed: true },\n  { title: \"Write finding indices challenge\", completed: false },\n  { title: \"Bake cookies\", completed: true },\n];\n\n// Before\nconsole.log(todos[index].completed); // false\n\nconst index = todos.findIndex(\n  x => x.title === \"Write finding indices challenge\"\n);\n\ntodos = [\n  ...todos.slice(0, index),\n  {\n    ...todos[index],\n    completed: true,\n  },\n  ...todos.slice(index + 1),\n];\n\n// After\nconsole.log(todos[index].completed); // true \n\n```\n# When is this useful? \n\nBoth of these functions do the same thing, but `findIndex` allows you more flexibility in what you search for. To this end they are both used in the same general case: You have an array and you want to find the index of some item within it.\n\nIf you are dealing with a simple array of strings, numbers, booleans, etc. `indexOf` is likely an easier choice, but `findIndex` can work as well.\n\nIf you are working with an array of objects or other arrays you will need to use `findIndex` to find what you are looking for based on some property of the object or the array. In the example above we used the `title` property to find the todo item we were looking for.\n\n---\n\n**NOTE:** If you just want to check if something exists in an array and you don't care _where_ in the array it is then use `includes`. Since both `findIndex` and `indexOf` return `-1` when something is not found they are less useful with conditional statements. See the following code:\n\n```typescript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 256];\n\n// This will not work, because indexOf(8) is -1 and if (-1) { ... } \n// is equivalent to if (true) { ... }. Only the number 0 is considered\n// false.\nif (numbers.indexOf(8)) {\n  console.log(\"Found 8\"); // This will log even though 8 is not in the array\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Could not find 8\");\n}\n\n// Using includes(8) gives us the answer we expect.\nif (numbers.includes(8)) {\n  console.log(\"Found 8\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Could not find 8\"); // This will log correctly, because 8 is not in the arary\n}\n\n```\n\n"

Many operations are much simpler on arrays or make more sense with arrays than with strings, however, what you ultimately want is a string not an array so you can do the following:\n\n* Convert a string to an array using `split`.\n* Manipulate the array in some way.\n* Convert the array back to a string using `join`.\n\n\nFor example, if you want to be more illegible online you could write a function to uppercase every other letter in your strings.\n\n```typescript\nconst trollSpeak = (str: string) => {\n  return str\n    .split(\"\")\n    .map((x, i) => (i % 2 === 0 ? x.toUpperCase() : x))\n    .join(\"\");\n}\n\nconsole.log(trollSpeak(\"wow it's so nice to be chatting online!\"));\n// => \"WoW It's sO NiCe tO Be cHaTtInG OnLiNe!\"\n\n```\n\nFun\\! What we did here is took a string then did the following steps, just like described above:\n\n1. `split` the string into an array. In this case we `split` on `\"\"` which is an empty string. What this does it it splits all characters of a string separately. Example: `\"wow\".split(\"\");` would give us `[\"w\", \"o\", \"w\"]`\n1. `map` each element of the array. In this case the mapping function calls `toUpperCase` on the string if it's even. Using `i % 2 === 0` is a pretty common pattern to determine if something is even, and in this case we run the uppercase function if it's even. The result is every other character getting uppercased.\n1. `join` the array back into a string. Again we use `\"\"` to join without anything in between. To put it another way we join the elements of the array with an empty string in between.\n\n# When is this useful?\n\nWhenever you want to convert from a string to an array or vice versa. \n\nYou won't always need to convert back to a string either. Sometimes you go from string to array and keep the array. Other times you start with an array of data but you simply want a string. "

You don't have to worry about array indexing syntax, loop syntax, or when to start and stop your loop.\n* It's directly related to your array. `for` loops can be used with arrays but they have no direct relation. A `for` loop lets you run some code N times where you get to choose what number N is.\n\n\n## Benefits of for loops\n\n* You get to `break` and `continue` in for loops. This can be very important for writing algorithms that run faster because you can skip work if it's not needed. `forEach` does not have this functionality.\n* You can iterate backwards, step\\-wise or any way you want. Using a `for` loop you can iterate backwards through an array, you can iterate over every even number, etc. You are much less constrained in how you loop.\n   * This makes `for` loops more powerful and more flexible than `forEach`, but it also makes `for` loops less well\\-suited to simply iterating over the elements of an array.\n\n\n> **Rule of thumb:** If you're wondering which one to use, try to use `forEach` and if it doesn't work for your use case then fall back to using a `for` loop\\.\n# When is this useful?\n\nWhenever you want to run some code for every element of an array.\n\n**NOTE:** If you want to _transform_ every element of an array it is simpler to use `map` rather than `forEach`."

          "content": "Unfortunately Objects do not give you the same helpful functions as arrays. Namely functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, etc.\n\nTo get around this there are a number of helper functions specifically for Objects that you can use to accomplish these tasks. These functions are:\n\n* `Object.keys`\n   * Returns an array of all _keys_ of an object. `Object.keys({ name: 'Maomi', job: 'Sleeping' })` returns `[\"name\", \"job\"]`.\n* `Object.values`\n   * Returns an array of all _values_ of an object. `Object.values({ name: 'Maomi', job: 'Sleeping' })` returns `[\"Maomi\", \"Sleeping\"]`.\n* `Object.entries`\n   * Returns an array of all **keys and values** of an object. Since it returns a key and a value you will have an array of arrays. `Object.entries({ name: 'Maomi', job: 'Sleeping' })` returns `[[\"name\", \"Maomi\"], [\"Job\", \"Sleeping\"]]`.\n\n\nThis may seem a bit roundabout, and it is, but it's what's built\\-in for you to use. You can always write your own helper functions that allow you to map over arrays and objects the same way.\n# A common pattern\n\nJust as we can operate on strings by converting to an array and back again, we can do the same with objects. The implementation is a bit more cumbersome than with strings but the underlying idea is the same:\n\n1. Use `Object.entries` to convert an object into an array of key\\-value pairs.\n1. Operate on the array of key\\-value pairs using whatever array methods you like\n1. Use `reduce` to convert the array of key\\-value pairs into an object\n\n\nLet's see an example. We'll use a simplified `cities` object from the challenge:\n\n```typescript\nconst cities = {\n  \"New York\": {\n    primaryLanguage: \"English\",\n    population: 8336817,\n  },\n  Tokyo: {\n    primaryLanguage: \"Japanese\",\n    population: 13942856,\n  },\n  Taipei: {\n    primaryLanguage: \"Mandarin\",\n    population: 2646204,\n  },\n};\n\n// 1) Turn the object into key-value pairs\nconst pairs = Object.entries(cities);\n\n// This is entirely made up, but we'll say a city is \"huge\" \n// if it has more than 5 million people\nconst isHuge = x => x.population > 5000000;\n\n// 2) Operate on the key-value pairs. In this case assign\n// a \"huge\" property to every object. true means the city\n// has more than 5 million people.\nconst mappedPairs = pairs.map(([k, v]) => {\n  const newValue = { ...v, huge: isHuge(v) };\n  return [k, newValue]\n});\n\n// 3) Use reduce to turn the pairs back into an object\nconst mappedCities = mappedPairs.reduce((agg, [k, v]) => {\n  return { ...agg, [k]: v };\n}, {});\n\nconsole.log(mappedCities); // The result will look like what's below\n// {\n//   \"New York\": {\n//     primaryLanguage: \"English\",\n//     population: 8336817,\n//     huge: true,\n//   },\n//   Tokyo: {\n//     primaryLanguage: \"Japanese\",\n//     population: 13942856,\n//     huge: true,\n//   },\n//   Taipei: {\n//     primaryLanguage: \"Mandarin\",\n//     population: 2646204,\n//     huge: false,\n//   },\n// }\n\n```\n\nSince converting from an array of key\\-value pairs is fairly common, you could even create a helper function to do it for you:\n\n```typescript\ntype KeyValuePairs = [string, any][];\n\nconst fromPairs = (x: KeyValuePairs) => x.reduce((agg, [k, v]) => {\n  return { ...agg, [k]: v };\n}, {});\n\n// Now you can use this fromPairs function on an array of key-value pairs.\n// The code below essentially does nothing because fromParis is the inverse\n// operation of Object.entries\nfromPairs(Object.entries({ isObject: true })); // => { isObject: true }\n\n```\n# When is this useful?\n\nWhenever you want to use array functions on an object. For example, if you want to `map`, `filter`, or `reduce` elements of an object."

          "content": "Let's talk about changes. The mutation refers to modifying data. Let's jump right in to an example:\n# Example: Mutable Arrays\n\n```typescript\nconst a = [];\nconst b = a;\nconsole.log(a, b); // [] []\nconsole.log(a === b); // true\n\n```\n\nHere we have an array `a` and a variable `b` set to the same array. `a` is equal to `b` \\(not surprising\\) and the array is currently empty but we can change that.\n\n```typescript\na.push(\"ch-ch-changes!\");\nconsole.log(a, b); // [\"ch-ch-changes!\"] [\"ch-ch-changes!\"]\nconsole.log(a === b); // true\n\n```\n\nThe array has changed and it is _still the same array_. Is it obvious that the second `console.log` would return `true`? Moreover, is it obvious that `b` is _also_ changed when we changed `a`? Regardless, the array has changed despite still being the same array. In fact, we would say ++it has been mutated++. Arrays are mutable, meaning they can change without becoming a new array. \n\nThis is still a bit abstract, so let's look at another example.\n# Example: Immutable Strings\n\n```typescript\nlet c = \"hello\";\nlet d = c;\nconsole.log(c, d); // \"hello\" \"hello\"\nconsole.log(c === d); // true\n\n```\n\nHere we have a string `c` and another variable `d` equal to the same string. `c` and `d` are very unsurprisingly equal. Now, just like with the array we can change our string. You may have also noticed that we used `let` rather than `const` here\\. We'll get to that in a moment.\n\n```typescript\nc = c + \" world\";\nconsole.log(c, d); // \"hello world\" \"hello\"\nconsole.log(c === d); // false\n\n```\n\nHere we modified `c` by appending `\" world\"` to the end, but `d` remains unchanged. This also seems like the expected behavior, but why is it different for strings an arrays. Furthermore, we had to _reassign_ `c` in order to change it. There is no equivalent of `push` for strings. \n\nStrings are immutable, meaning that you cannot change strings—you cannot mutate strings. You can create new strings and you can change what string a variable is assigned to, but you do not change the string itself.\n\nTo further highlight this difference, consider the following example. Although arrays are mutable we do not _have to_ mutate them:\n\n```typescript\nlet e = [\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]\nlet f = e;\nconsole.log(e === f); // true\ne = e.concat([\" \", \"w\", \"o\", \"r\", \"l\", \"d\"]);\nconsole.log(e === f); // false\n\n```\n\nHere we see that we updated `e` without changing the underlying array and without changing `f`. The key is that we _created a new array_ rather than mutating the existing array.\n# Immutability\n\nImmutable types cannot be mutated. They are generally simpler to work with because you **always know** they cannot be mutated. Whenever you are operating on a string you know that if you change the string a new string is created.\n\nMutable types can be mutated. This generally means you have to be more careful when working with mutable types in certain ways. A common mistake is to assume that `array1 === array2` will be `false` if one of the arrays change. This is not true. If the two variables reference the same array they will remain equal even as the array changes.\n# Mutable and Immutable Methods\n\nAs you saw above, some array methods mutate the array and some do not. In general, most array methods **do not** mutate the array. `map`, `filter`, `reduce` for example all create array copies and do not mutate the array. However, some do. Most notably, the `push` method will modify the array rather than create a copy.\n# Mutability Reference\n\nHere are the common types you will be interacting with and whether or not they can be mutated.\n| **Type** | **Mutable?** |\n|:--- |:--- |\n| `string` | No |\n| `number` | No |\n| `boolean` | No |\n| Array | ⚠️ Yes |\n| Object | ⚠️ Yes |\n# Tradeoffs of Mutability\n\nAs with anything in engineering there are tradeoffs to immutable or mutable data types. However, a quick note:\n\n> The benefits and tradeoffs will be less apparent until you start programming larger programs.\n\nThe course challenges are intentionally designed to be roughly bite\\-sized to introduce concepts quickly and provide immediate feedback. However, much of the benefits of immutability and the drawbacks only become viscerally apparent in a larger codebase.\n\n## Immutability Benefits\n\nThe big benefit of immutable data is it makes for much simpler programs. It's easier to reason about data flow when you know that your data cannot change—new data can be created but none of your variables will secretly get updated without you knowing.\n\n## Immutability Drawbacks\n\nThe big drawback of immutability is performance. Immutable data means your program will use more memory for duplicate data and will spend more CPU power copying data. However, modern computers \\(including mobile devices\\) are _extremely_ powerful and have no problem copying data or using slightly more memory.\n\n> In short, immutability will have no performance impact on mobile devices or the web.\n\nIt's still quite possible to write slow code and to bring even modern devices to a grinding halt by writing terrible software, but the point is it is our mistakes as programmers that cause these issues not the immutable data we use.\n\nIf later in your career you decide to start programming low\\-level systems like operating systems or ATM machines then you will care much more about performance, but you will also know much more by then so you will be able to tackle the problem.\n# Mutation is not reassignment\n\n\n## Mutation\n\nIn this example the second `console.log` is not what we would initially expect. Why? `jarbles` was directly modified but `bestFriend` was not, not directly. However, `bestFriend` has indeed changed along with `jarbles`. This may not seem all that bad, or even undesirable, but the issue is that in a real project you might have 100 lines of of code between the first `console.log` and the second. It's much simpler to be able to guarantee that a variable has not changed than it is to worry about what it might be.\n\n```typescript\nconst jarbles = { name: \"Jarbles\", job: \"Cat Trainer\" };\nconst bestFriend = jarbles;\nconsole.log(`My best friend is ${bestFriend.name}!`);\n\njarbles.job = \"Cow Tipper\"; // Oh oh... \n\nconsole.log(`My friend really loves cats, their job is ${bestFriend.job}`)\n\n```\n\n## Reassignment\n\nReassignment is much easier to avoid than mutation because you can simply use `const` to ensure a variable is never reassigned. In fact, this is why we always use `const` instead of `let` unless something is specifically going to be reassigned. This practice ensures that neither you nor someone else working on your code with you accidentally reassigns something that shouldn't be.\n\n```\nconst jarbles = { name: \"Jarbles\", job: \"Cat Trainer\" };\nconst bestFriend = jarbles;\nconst jarbles = { name: \"Jarbles\", job: \"Cat Trainer\" };\nconst bestFriend = jarbles;\nconsole.log(`My best friend is ${bestFriend.name}!`);\n\n// No way Bongle! This will break the code so there's no inserting yourself here\nbestFriend = { name: \"Bongle\" };\n\nconsole.log(`My friend really loves cats, their job is ${bestFriend.job}`)\n\n```\n# Best Practices\n\nThe best practices are simple:\n\n* Avoid mutation whenever possible.\n   * When working with arrays and objects use immutable methods or the spread operator to make changes without mutation.\n* Avoid reassignment whenever possible. \n   * Always use `const` unless you explicitly want to reassign something, in which case use `let`.\n\n\nMutation and reassignment are not bad, they allow for different solutions to different problems, however they come at the cost of cognitive overhead. Sometimes that cost is worth paying and sometimes its unavoidable.\n\nThe advice of this author is simply to be mindful of your data and deliberate with mutations and reassignments. \n# Functional Programming and Object\\-Oriented Programming\n\nMutability and immutability are often closely intertwined with the two primary language paradigms as follows:\n\n* Object\\-oriented programming loves mutability \\(or at least depends on it\\)\n* Functional programming loves immutability\n\n\n## Classes and Mutation\n\nThis is in large part due to the idioms of these two types of programming. Classes themself have no meaning without the notion internal state, and the defining feature of state is that it changes over time. Thus you generally won't find classes without much mutation. Sometimes they are used simply as namespaces, but in that case there are more direct mechanisms such as simple objects or modules so classes are still primarily useful in the context of state and mutation. \n\n## Functions and Immutability\n\nFunctions on the other hand are concerned with input and output. You pass in arguments and you get a return value. When you want to do complex things you write many functions and hook them all together end to end. We will see how to do this in the functional programming section.\n\nA function certainly could mutate it's arguments and pass them back \\(or not\\) but that's usually clumsy to write when you're expected to return a value. Furthermore a function that modifies its arguments is no longer pure and thus breaks purity guarantees that many functional programming principles depend on.\n# Immutability and Programming Languages\n\nIn this course we are concerned with TypeScript, which shares all the mutability characteristics of JavaScript as described here. However it is worth noting that other languages have different approaches to mutability.\n\nPrimarily object\\-oriented languages such as Ruby and Python tend more towards mutability, in large part simply because using classes is the idiomatic way to solve problems.\n\nPrimarily functional languages such as Clujure and Haskell have immutability built in to the language itself \\(think arrays and objects that cannot be mutated\\).\n\nJavaScript \\(and thus TypeScript\\) is a bit of an oddball language in this respect because you can choose to write highly functional code or highly object\\-oriented code. It's extremely flexible, which is both a blessing and a curse. Throughout your travels when reading code in the wild you may well discover you have no idea what's going on because the author created a bunch of abstractions you're unfamiliar with."

          "content": "# The Spread Operator\n\nGiven all this talk of mutating objects and arrays it's time to talk about how to make updates without mutating the original data. For example, consider the following object:\n\n```typescript\nconst person = { name: \"Jenna\", role: \"Management\" };\n\n```\n\nJenna has decided to break away from all the \"J\" names in her company and so she's changing her name to `\"Gemma\"`. How could we update the object to reflect this? The mutative way, the easy way is to just assign a new name on the object:\n\n```typescript\nperson.name = \"Gemma\";\nconsole.log(person); // { name: \"Gemma\", role: \"Management\" }\n\n```\n\nThis certainly accomplishes the update we want, but if we wanted to do it without mutation we need a new approach.\n# Enter the Spread Operator\n\nThere is a nifty operator called the spread operator which let's you extend or overwrite objects. The syntax is as follows \\(notice the `...`\\):\n\n```typescript\nconst updatedPerson = {\n  ...person,\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n};\nconsole.log(person); // { name: \"Jenna\", role: \"Management\" }\nconsole.log(updatedPerson); // { name: \"Gemma\", role: \"Management\" }\n\n```\n\nAs you can see the `person` object hasn't changed.\n# Order is important\n\nWhen using the spread operator it's very important to know what order you want to use it in. For example:\n\n```typescript\nconst person = { name: \"Jenna\", role: \"Management\" };\nconst a = {\n  ...person,\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n};\nconst b = {\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n  ...person,\n};\nconsole.log(a); // { name: \"Gemma\", role: \"Management\" }\nconsole.log(b); // { name: \"Jenna\", role: \"Management\" }\n\n```\n\nUsing the spread operator on an object will overwrite whatever came before. So if `person` has a `name` property it will overwrite any `name` property created earlier in the object. If this is not clear let's use some more verbose code to explain. \n\nHere are two equivalent ways to create an object:\n\n```\n// This is the standard way to create an object, but the two forms of \n// creating an object below are equivalent.\nconst a = { name: \"Gemma\" };\n\n// This will result in the same object as above, but it's more verbose\n// and requires more code.\nconst a = {};\na.name = \"Gemma\"\n\n```\nNote: This code wouldn't run in an editor because the constant `a` is defined twice, but it's just for demonstration purposes here.\n\nHere are two ways to give `a` all the properties of `person`:\n\n```\nconst a = {\n  ...person,\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n};\n\n// equivalent to this code\nconst a = {};\na.name = person.name;\na.role = person.role;\na.name = \"Gemma\";\n\n```\n\nNow let's look at the code with the order of `...person` changed so that it comes afterwards.\n\n```\nconst a = {\n  name: \"Gemma\",\n  ...person,\n};\n\n// equivalent to this code\nconst a = {};\na.name = \"Gemma\";\na.name = person.name;\na.role = person.role;\n\n```\n \nChanging the order has completely changed the ultimate value of `a.name`."

That criteria is specified in a function. This makes the `groupBy` function extremely flexible, because you can group by any criteria you want. \n\nFor example, consider the [Counting Word Occurrences](/workspace/0xs07JCP4) challenge\\. In that challenge we wanted to find out how frequently words occurred in a string. Using the `groupBy` function we can get a very similar answer in just a few lines of code:\n\n```\nconst sentence = \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. Remember, the fox was quick.\";\nconst words = sentence.split(\" \");\n\n// Our grouping function will lowercase the string and remove a period if present.\nconst groupingFunction = (x: string) => x.toLowerCase().replace(\".\", \"\");\n\ngroupBy(words, groupingFunction);\n// => \n// { \n//   the: ['The', 'the', 'the'], \n//   quick: ['quick', 'quick.'], \n//   ...etc \n// }\n\n```\n\nAs you can see this approach gives us a list of all occurrences of a word based on our `groupingFunction`, rather than the number of occurrences. To get the number from here we could easily use `.length` on each of the grouped arrays."

This function is called with consumer requests, and accepts a `Consumer` and `requestSize` as arguments. The distributor should provide goods to each consumer until the consumer has received the number of goods equal to the `rationLimit`. Once this limit is reached, no more goods should be returned for the consumer. Consumers are identified using their unique `id` attribute\\.\n\nThe goods are rationed because they are scarce\\! The `rationer` also accepts a second argument, `totalGoods`, which specifies the total supply of the good being rationed. Once this amount has been distributed, no more goods should be distributed, even to new consumers.\n\nWhen the goods are depleted, or when a consumer has reached their limit, the distributor should return `null`. If the goods are not depleted yet, the distributor should return as many goods as possible based on the request \\(in an array\\). For instance, if a consumer requests 10 goods, but the total goods supply is five, the distributor should return 5 goods: `[\"Goods\", \"Goods\", \"Goods\", \"Goods\", \"Goods\"]`.

          "content": "Asynchronous or \"async\" programming introduces the concept of _time_ into a computer program. Computer executes programs sequentially, line by line, in the exact order they were written. However, sometimes an operation has to make a request to some other software program, or another computer, and it must wait for the \"next instruction\" before it can continue.\n\nFor instance, perhaps a user submits an order to buy a product online. The order must be sent to a server and processed. It could fail\\! The client application \\(a webpage, a mobile app, etc.\\) must _wait for the response_ from the request before it can proceed. Depending on the response, the program may take different actions.\n\nThis is what \"async\" programming refers to. More generally, it refers to the concept in programming of allowing units of work to be separated and run in parallel. The e\\-commerce app in the above example could still function and perform other tasks if necessary while waiting for the transaction to succeed or fail.\n\nHere's an example of a simple asynchronous program in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\n// Define an interface for products\ninterface Product {\n    id: string;\n    amount: number;\n}\n\n// Submit a transaction to buy a product\nconst submitTransaction = async (product: Product) => {\n    try {\n        // Send request to the server API\n        const result = await API.sendBuyRequestToServer(product);\n        return result;\n    } catch (err) {\n        return \"Request failed!\";\n    }\n};\n\n// Create a product\nconst pairwise: Product = {\n    id: \"sad98f7\",\n    amount: 5.00,\n}\n\n// Submit a purchase request for the product\nconst purchaseResult = submitTransaction(pairwise);\n\n// See the result\nconsole.log(purchaseResult);\n\n\n```\n\nTry to read through the code, but don't worry if you don't understand all of it\\!\n\nThe last thing to mention in this introduction is the idea of an _API\\._ This stands for \"Application Programming Interface\" and it's a big phrase to refer to something simple: the rules for talking to a program from the outside.\n\nProgramming languages define strict rules for how to communicate instructions to computers. Computer programs must also define strict rules if other computer programs can interact with them. That's all an API is. An API defines the rules for how you can make requests to another program.\n\nFor example, in our hypothetical e\\-commerce store above, the server presents some API which allows you to purchase a product. This API requires a `Product` with an `id` and `amount`, and in the example is represented by the function `API.sendBuyRequestToServer`. In a real program, this function would make a network request to a server. Some seconds would pass while this is happening, before the result comes back and the program continues executing.\n\nYou will find that APIs and asynchronous programming are indispensable for building modern software applications. Apps simply just have to talk to other apps to get data and perform actions\\! This module is all about teaching you how to write asynchronous code and interact with APIs. Let's get started\\!"

You know the ins and outs of a popular programming language, you have a set of tools to work as a modern developer, and you understand how to write code which interacts with other computer systems. This is an important milestone in your learning journey\\!\n\nWhat you have learned so far will be transferrable to any other programming language you decide to learn in the future\\! Take a moment to congratulate yourself, and get ready to dive further down the rabbit hole.\n---\n\n### Enter React\n\nNow we will embark on the journey of the learning numerous tools, libraries, and frameworks which will equip you to build modern, real\\-world applications. Software engineers do not write everything from scratch. Instead, they use existing software as much as possible. React is the first tool like this for you to learn.\n\nReact is a library for building user interfaces.\n\nThe site you are looking at right now is built with React. React is built and open sourced by Facebook, and if you use any of the Facebook products you have used applications powered by React. React is very popular and the leading choice for building user interfaces. In the software development industry, React is one of the most in demand skills. In addition, it's very versatile. You can write web apps, mobile apps, and even desktop apps using React.\n\nBut what is a user interface library, exactly?\n\nIt's a tool which let's you build the frontend, or user interface, of an application very easily. It provides abstractions to handle common tasks and operations efficiently, safely, and easily. For example, consider this code:\n\n```typescript\nconst Greeting = (name?: string) => {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <h1>\n                {name ? `Hello, ${name}` : \"Hello and welcome!\"}\n            </h1>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\n```\n\nThis code may look strange, and slightly \\(un\\)familiar to you. It may look like TypeScript. Or it may remind you of HTML. Or it may resemble a mishmash of both together. Well, it's exactly that\\! Another name for it is JSX \\(a syntax extension of JavaScript\\), but you will come to recognize this simply as _React\\._\n\nWhat it does is simple. It's a function which greets you by `name`, if you provide the function with a `name` argument, otherwise it displays a default greeting. React allows you to build HTML directly with the power of a programming language.\n\nIn this module, we will learn all about it\\!"

For instance, the server for Pairwise receives numerous requests as you work through the course. The client frontend sends updates on your progress which the server processes and records. When you signup and login the server handles these requests and creates a user entry for you in a database which the server can access. It stores your progress in association with this user. And, it does this for all the users who access Pairwise. The server is \\(should be\\) always available to handle requests from client applications.\n\nServers may seem daunting\\! But don't worry, they are just computer programs and you learned everything you need to write computer programs in the first course modules. Servers are just composed of functions, classes, and data structures.\n\nIn general, a typical server exposes an API for clients to send it requests. It then has a layer of business logic which handles processing client requests, storing and updating data. Then, finally, it has another layer which is responsible for interacting with a database and persisting or retrieving data.\n\nAs you might imagine, there are many tools and libraries for writing server applications which provide some of the common scaffolding and features modern servers require.\n\nIn this module, we will learn about some of these tools and get some practice building and thinking about some of the common components servers use.

Databases are crucial to building modern software applications. They are responsible for storing and backing up the data which makes your applications valuable. Whether it's user profiles, chat messages, transaction records, inventory, or anything else, these are all stored and persisted in a database.\n\nAt a basic level, a database is just a hard disk on a computer where information is stored. As we will see, there are several different types of databases, which are all used for different purposes. Like many things in software engineering, there are tradeoffs to choosing one database type over another.\n\nThe two most common types of databases are relational and non\\-relational. SQL is the canonical relational database, which you may have heard of before.  A SQL database defines a strict schema for what data and relationships between data look like. If you are using a SQL database you can rely on the database schema to enforce integrity for your data.\n\nOn the other hand, a non\\-relational database doesn't have a strict schema like a SQL database does. Non\\-relational databases are great when you have unstructured data, data in inconsistent formats, data with an unknown format, or other types of flexible requirements. Common non\\-relational databases are MongoDB and Redis, along with several others.\n\nIn this module, we will learn the basics for these different types of databases and get some practice working directly writing, reading, and updating data.

          "content": "In this module you will learn the basics of programming mobile apps. Specifically, you will learn React Native, a cross\\-platform technology which allows developers to build iOS and Android apps with a single codebase.\n\n### The History\n\nFirst, a quick word of introduction and history about mobile apps.\n\nMobile apps began to exist with the invention of the iPhone in 2007. Since then, smart phones and mobile apps have grown tremendously. Traditionally mobile app development has required app developers to develop separate applications for different platforms. This is because the dominant platforms, iOS and Android, are totally different and therefore apps on these platforms are built using different technologies and programming languages which are specialized for those devices.\n\nTraditionally, \"native\" mobile apps are written using Objective\\-C or Swift on iOS, and Java or Kotlin on Android. However, product teams want their apps to provide a consistent experience across both platforms, but this can be challenging for engineering teams which must build and maintain completely separate codebases in different languages which attempt to duplicate the same features, functionality, and user experiences on multiple devices.\n\nIt breaks one of the fundamental rules of programming: **Don't Repeat Yourself.**\n\n### Cross Platform Mobile Frameworks\n\nIn the past few years, several \"cross\\-platform frameworks\" have emerged which allow developers to write mobile apps using a single codebase and language. These apps are then compiled to run on the specific target device, whether that is iOS or Android, or some other target.\n\nThis provides huge benefits: engineering teams can focus on maintaining a single codebase which runs on both platforms. Product teams can move more quickly iterating product ideas and building new features. However, the drawback is that these frameworks tend to experience some disadvantages compared to writing a native app. For instance, native apps tend to have better performance, more seamless user device interactions, and can use some native device APIs more effectively.\n\n### React Native\n\nThat being said, there is still a strong shift in the adoption of cross\\-platform frameworks for mobile app development. As you may know, there is a framework which allows you to write mobile apps using React called _React Native_. It works by running a JavaScript application \\(i.e. React\\) directly on the mobile device and then transforming React's UI updates to update the UI on the phone \\(instead of the HTML UI of a webpage\\). Don't worry about the complexities of how it works right now, we can cover that in a special topic lesson later. The beautiful thing is you don't have to understand the implementation details in order to use the framework effectively.\n\nThere are also a few other frameworks like React Native, another popular one is Flutter.\n\n### This Module\n\nHere, we will get some experience with React Native. You will find that writing React Native apps requires learning almost nothing new if you already know React\\! This is really powerful. There are some specific device APIs which exist for mobile apps which are not present on the web, but other than that your existing knowledge is fully transferrable to the world of mobile.\n\nLet's start writing some mobile apps\\!"

          "content": "In this module you will learn about how to test software and automate common tasks in order to improve productivity. The idea of testing software is to create automated tests which will verify your software performs correctly and provides the functionality users expect. The value of tests is to give teams confidence to ship changes to software projects and know that their changes did not break some existing behavior or feature.\n\n### Regressions\n\nRegressions occur when you change some code and something totally seemingly unrelated breaks. If you continue on your journey of learning to code you will definitely experience it one day. Regressions happen like this:\n\n* You spend 3 weeks building a new feature in a product to let users post comments on some posts.\n* You ship the feature.\n* The next day at work, someone asks \"Hey, is the user login broken?\"\n* You sit still and start listening and thinking, nervous.\n* You didn't touch the user login, you probably didn't break it.... you say to yourself.\n* Someone else confirms: \"Yes, it appears to be broken\".\n* \"What happened\"? Another person says.\n* ... You are frozen now.\n* A while later, it is discovered how your new feature inadvertently broke the user login.\n* You rush to try to fix the problem and deploy an update to production.\n\n\n### Best Practice Testing\n\nThis is a regression, is this is exactly the type of thing software testing is intended to prevent. Ideally, a best practice workflow would look like this:\n\n* You build the feature.\n* You open a pull request to merge your feature into the main branch of your team's codebase.\n* Automated tests run to check the code on your feature branch.\n* The tests check the user login feature, and the tests fail.\n* You immediately see feedback that the user login is broken on your branch.\n* You debug the problem and fix it.\n* You update your branch, the tests run again and pass.\n* All of this happens in a safe testing environment, doesn't impact any users, and doesn't require any manual human interaction.\n* You ship your feature, and this time sleep peacefully at night knowing the code works and will not cause any fires in production.\n\n\nThe hard part, of course, is writing tests which truly verify an application's intended functionality works correctly. You will find that it's impossible to test all the ways a user could think of to break an application. And, it's important that tests are easy to read, write, understand, in addition to being simple and fast to run. You don't want to spend more time working on tests than you do building the business logic which supports your product.\n\n### Automation\n\nThis module will walk through a lot of techniques for testing software and also touch on a related topic: automation. Automation is the powerful idea of making commands do mundane and repetitive tasks for you. It has endless advantages and software is a perfect tool for automation. Computers are just really good at doing the same thing over and over and following instructions perfectly\\!\n\nLearning how to automate tasks is a force\\-multiplier skill for software engineers and very important to learn. In this module we will get some practice automating tasks and learning about common ways automation is used in the software development process."

They are as important as writing code correctly from scratch.\n\nIn this module, we will equip you with tools and techniques which will make you more effective at debugging code, and we will walk through some strategies for refactoring code as well. In addition, we will provide a number of challenges were there is some mistake in the code that you must find, debug and fix.

This can be a lot more complicated than you may think at first.\n\nYour client application must be hosted somewhere so it can be served quickly to your users when they visit a page and make a request for your app.\n\nYour server must be deployed in the cloud somewhere, possibly with multiple instances running. You need to have monitoring, alerting, and logging so you know if your server encounters any issues, failures, or errors. Maybe you also need rate limiting, caching, and other configuration and setup.\n\nYou database must be deployed, backed up, and possibly supplied with read replicas for performance. It should be secure and only accessible by your production server or possibly administrator users.\n\nAnd that's just a very simple setup\\!\n\nFinally, as your team makes changes to your applications updates should be delivered and deployed to your production system continuously. You never want to hit a big red \"Deploy the App\" button. Ideally, deployments ship continuously as you merge code, tests run automatically and stop deployments when they fail, and your technical team can focus their efforts on building business logic and features rather than fighting fires or troubleshooting manual deployment nightmare scenarios.\n\nAs you can start to see... this world of \"devops\" \\(developer operations\\) is a lot more complex than it may seem at first. That's why it is such an important skillset to be familiar with as a developer.
