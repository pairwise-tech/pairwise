          "content": "Pairwise is a re\\-imagination of modern education.\n\n### Background\n\nSocieties all around the world follow the same pattern of education: 8 hours of classroom education per day for over 10 years, and then more of the same in college or university. This is probably a great model for learning many subjects, e.g. foreign language or mathematics, but it may not be the best format for learning practical skills like how to program or build computer applications.\n\nAt Pairwise, we think this traditional model is not the most efficient learning model for learning practical technology skills in the modern age.\n\nMoreover, the internet and computer revolution have given individuals new powerful tools which unlock new capabilities. You can now ask Google a question and within seconds find detailed information about the answer. This has never before been possible in human history.\n\nYou can also build and deploy applications and products at global scale using just a simple laptop, at very low cost. This has never before been possible in human history.\n\n### Enter Pairwise\n\nAt Pairwise, we think that there is a big opportunity for re\\-inventing educational resources for teaching modern technology skills. Software skills do not need to be learned from a textbook, or by sitting in a classroom listening to a lecture or slideshow, or by taking tests or exams. We think software skills are best learned through hands\\-on application, and, like, most skills, best learned with the help of a thoughtful mentor.\n\nThe Pairwise platform is meant to be this combination of hands\\-on practice and mentorship. The Pairwise platform is designed to teach concepts through practical application while also providing enough supplementary content support for students to understand the skills they are learning.\n\nOur belief is the process can be fun, engaging, adventurous, and challenging \\- almost like a game\\!\n\n### Information Overload\n\nWhile the internet has made the world's information accessible to everyone in mere seconds, this is a blessing and a curse. The curse is that there is simply _too_ much information.\n\nFor the student learning to code, there is simply too much information out there. There are hundreds of hours of recorded university computer science lectures alone, not to mention other tutorials, guides, and platforms. How does someone navigate all of these limitless content and resources and choose what to learn? Moreover, how does one even decide_ what_ to learn? JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, C/C\\+\\+, Go, Rust \\- the list goes on, and those are just the leading programming languages, not to mention specific popular technologies or engineering specialities. To someone interested in learning to code... it's just too much\\!\n\n### The Secret of Pairwise\n\nThis is the other secret of Pairwise: we curate a specific, focused, opinionated curriculum of content which we believe represents the fastest, easiest, and most efficient pathway to **a\\)** learning to code and **b\\)** getting hired as a software developer. This frees the student from the responsibility of deciding what to learn, and lets them focus exclusively on learning. The result is massive productivity gains in the learning process.\n\nInstead of typing _\"Should I learn C\\+\\+ or Java?\"_ into Google, you will start typing _\"How to filter something from a list in TypeScript?\"_. All the time previously devoted to trying to decide _what_ to learn will now be spent on _learning\\._\n\nThis may feel strange... what if we didn't choose the right technologies or languages for you to learn?\\!\n\nConsider how universities work: Once you decide you want to be a doctor, or physicist, or even a software engineer, how much freedom do you have to decide _what_ you will learn along the way? You make the initial choice, but from there the teacher, textbook, and school take over. You start on Chapter 1 whether you like it or not. _They_ curate the content and path for you.\n\nWe are not saying we know what's best for _everyone _to learn. We are saying that it is more productive to spend your time learning rather than asking _what_ you should learn. We have made broad approximations best on industry trends and job market data to select a course which should be the most efficient for the most people. If you're curious, feel free to [read our full rationale](https://www.pairwise.tech/curriculum) for the curriculum selection.\n\nWe believe that by curating this path for the user, it can save them from the endless headaches of having to answer these questions themselves. The can focus on what matters: learning, solving problems, and building apps. If they like the process, then this is the right career for them and they can take it from there to any destination they want\\!\n\n### Only a Foundation\n\nPairwise is intended to train a new generation of software engineers. If we succeed, some of our graduates will go on to do things far beyond what we can do. Pairwise just lays the foundation and teaches people fundamental software engineering skills, and, most importantly gives people a guide for _how to learn_. From there, they can go on to independently master any other technologies they will need in their career."
