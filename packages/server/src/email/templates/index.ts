/** ===========================================================================
 * Email Templates
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file provides email templates. To edit more complicated templates, such
 * as the Welcome Email, you can find the original email HTML in this same
 * sub-folder.
 *
 * The original HTML files are preserved here to make editing them and
 * previewing the result easier. Note that these files are not actually used
 * by the application, however. Instead, the inline text and HTML in this
 * file (which are produced from the HTML files) are used.
 *
 * You can edit these HTML files directly, and then use a conversion tool like
 * https://htmlemail.io/inline/ to convert the HTML document to inline-styles
 * to use as an email, and then copy the result into this file here.
 *
 * The HTML files are preserved in this folder, in addition to an index.html
 * which is used for editing HTML content directly. Open this with the
 * edit:email npm command.
 *
 * NOTE: The conversion tool may not work perfectly! You should verify the
 * output is correct, and you may need to search and use a different tool.

          We are so happy you signed up! Pairwise is a new product to teach
          people to code, and we want to design <i>the best</i> learning
          experience for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you haven't already, we recommend our
          <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pairwise.tech/workspace/yxZjmD0o/welcome-to-pairwise" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">Intro Challenge</a>
          on how the Pairwise platform works, or you get started with one of
          these challenges now:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://app.pairwise.tech/workspace/5ziJI35f/html-language-web" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">Intro to HTML</a>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The curriculum is a linear series of challenges, projects and videos
          you can solve on your own time and schedule. We try to walk through
          all the skills and technologies required for you to learn how to build
          real world applications and land a job as a software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you ever have problems or suggestions, there is a feedback feature
          built into the Pairwise workspace for you to use. Or, feel free to
          just respond to this email to contact us directly. We love to hear
          from students and will try to reply to you directly.

          By the way, your account is uniquely identified by your email address.
          If you use another SSO provider to sign in, that account <b>must</b> match

* If you have any questions, please just respond to this email. You can also request a refund up to 30 days after your purchase.

* By the way, your course purchase is linked to your account for this email address. If you login with a different SSO provider in the future (which is associated with another email address) a <i>new</i> Pairwise account will be created and you may be confused. Pairwise identifies accounts by relying on unique email addresses. Always login to Pairwise using the same SSO provider or email address to avoid any problems, thank you!
